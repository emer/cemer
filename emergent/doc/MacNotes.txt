Mac Port Notes

ReadLine

Readline is not installed by default. Obtained from:
http://www.hmug.org/pub/MacOS_X/BSD/Libraries/System/readline/

TODO:
* may need to make sure default install location is overridden
  to be /usr, not /usr/local, since gcc doesn't look in /usr/local/lib
  by default
OR link readline and jpeg libs in /usr/lib

Things To Do

1. Install readline per the Makefile.mac-g++
2. Install jpeg per same.
3. Install Qt3.3.4
add the qt folder to DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

You should symlink the Qt libs into /usr/lib :ln -sf $QTDIR/lib/libqt.3.dylib /usr/libln -sf $QTDIR/lib/libqui.1.dylib /usr/libln -sf $QTDIR/lib/libqt-mt.3.dylib /usr/lib

4. Install Coin/Inventor.

You should symlink the Coin lib into /usr/lib:

ln -s /Library/Frameworks/Inventor.framework/Versions/B/Libraries/libCoin.dylib /usr/lib

5. Install Coin/SoQt.

ln -s /Library/Frameworks/SoQt.framework/Versions/A/Libraries/libSoQt.dylib /usr/lib

NOTES

* it seems that gcc/qt combo requires us to explicitly instantiate templates
  used from qt, including nested templates (ex QValueListPrivate<T>)
