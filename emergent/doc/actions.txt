Actions

Actions on menus will follow the following paradigms:

Unary Operations
  ex. obj1:Class1
  obj->Class1::Method()
  
  ex. n obj's, common subclass ClassX
  for i from 0 to n-1
     obj[i]->ClassX::Method()
     
     
Binary/N-way Operations 

Target/Source - Target is 1st selected;
                Source(s) is remaining selected
  ex. obj1, obj2:Class2
  obj1->Method(Class2 obj2)
  
  ex. obj1, n obj's: common subclass ClassX
  for i from 1 to n
    obj1->Method(ClassX obj[i])

Source/Target - Source is 1st selected (ex. a Spec)
                Target(s) is remaining selected
  ex. obj1::Class1, obj2
  obj2->Method(Class1 obj1)
  
  ex. obj1, n obj's: common subclass ClassX
  for i from 1 to n
    obj[i]->Method(ClassX obj1)

DEFINITIONS

Prime - the first (or only) item selected
N-ways - the second and subsequent items selected

    
SEMANTIC RULES

1. Transitivity

If 2 classes have methods as follows:
  Class1::MethodA(Class2 obj)
  Class2::MethodB(Class1 obj)
then these methods must perform the same operation (i.e., lead to the same result.)



ENUMERATING

Given a set of 1 or more selected items, what menu choices to show?

1. Find common subclass of all, to show the available Unary operators

2. Find common subclass ClassX of N-way items (2-N).
   List all operations on Prime that take a ClassX (or predecessor)
