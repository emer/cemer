ROSBridgeClient
===============

A Java client for ROSBridge

This project is functional, and has been tested in use in several contexts. However, it is undocumented and has no unit or other test code, so it is likely not to be robust.

Look at com/jilk/ros/Example.java to see how to use it. You'll need to be familiar with ROS.
