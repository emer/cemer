<td><pre>* set text to always be black for HiLight buttons which are what show up on our dialogs
* do NOT call our custom window resizing / repositioning code -- it is not well behaved
and causes significant problems on mac..
* resize cluster dialog based on font -- we should do this universally -- most dialogs
are manually sized based on a 12 point font, so just rescale in proportion to font relative to 12 -- should put this in taiMisc
* fixed MAJOR bug in MSN learning (i.e., PBWM matrix) -- standardly using ach signal
to clear trace (instead of dopamine! da is discounted but ach is not, so it is much more
reliable signal), but ach was clearing trace during at the 2nd quarter learning part of
the trial -- before the dopamine arrived in the 4th quarter!  Not really sure how this
worked before, but it works a LOT better now..  could make this an option but
basically da ALWAYS shows up in 4th quarter only at this point, so hard coded for now.
* added new params for exploring learning opts in msn cons: don't allow "otr" to increase weights, and have a max act that saturates the increases..

<td><pre>oreilly</pre></td>
<td><pre>* MAJOR fix to undo and general datatable saving code: the row_indexes data for
DataTable was not being subject to the same optimized saving logic as the
DataCol elements -- so e.g., even if you had SAVE_ROWS OFF, it would save the
row_indexes -- discovered this with the lvis backprop model, which was just hanging
for no apparent reason -- turns out it was computing a massive diff
* also major fix for diff: if the size of the two strings is bigger than (.5) of the diff
limit, then just fork off a new source right away -- the hanging diff was caused
by a major difference in size between two strings..
* added better undo debug stuff, including saving of undo source so you can see
what is taking up all the space..
* added taMisc::is_auto_saving -- data table had code for optimizing the auto save
but it was actually being called all the time!  now only for auto saves..
* added taiMisc::resizeByMainFont method and associated other ones, that resize
gui elements as function of difference in font size compared to default -- now applied
to all dialogs with manual sizing, AND to the basic taiMisc sizing code
-- which used to just have some fairly random sizing logic there --
this now FIXES various alignment issues I was having with the edit dialog stripes,
with a larger font..
* the iTableView now uses font size information to try to set row height -- not clear
if it is actually different.. needs more work probably.

<td><pre>* Increment version to 8.0.1 in prep for new relase.
* add row_height member to DataTable for setting manual row height -- 0 = use default --
I was in this code and thought it would be easy but then quickly got lost so this is
as far as I got -- John you can take it from here!
* prevent an annoying double-resize of css console window when computer goes to sleep --
console now keeps it size..
* console also now has a special show event timer that does a clear, so it always
starts up with the command prompt showing (finally!)
* added SAVE_UNIT_NAMES flag to Layer, and got rid of SAVE_UNITS and NO_SAVE_UNITS which
were obsolete.  this is the easy way to activate the unit_names field, and keep the
geom updating with the layer geom.

<td><pre>* GpiInvUnitSpec::trl_refract -- prevent repeated gating within same trial -- gpi known
to have refractgory dynamics, and this prevents strange gating behavior
* separate factors for each cell in gated / not-gated, go / nogo, pos / neg da combinations -- logic can be made for different considerations for each case:
https://grey.colorado.edu/ccnlab/index.php/PBWM_V5.0#Bidirectional_Dopamine_Effects_Interacting_with_Gating
* got rid of da reset of trace -- fundamentally unreliable -- always using ach reset of trace.
