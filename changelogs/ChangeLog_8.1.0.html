<td><pre>* major fix for user-data saving: code was checking only for taPtrList_impl but
taList_impl is a *multiple inheritance* child with the ptrlist as 2nd class, so size
member is in a different place.. yuk.  checked that this doesn't appear to be happening
anywhere else! This now fixes reliability of saving splitter sizes etc for windows,
and various other user data settings since that save fix was implemented..
* don't update plugin dependencies if there aren't any active plugins!  and also for
autosave -- should speed up saving in most cases

- very useful where the search won't get you the list you want but you want to display clickable items
- used now for Functions - list callers
- specs - "where used"
- still to do - Programs - list callers
- I'll probably enhance the dialog by allowing callers to add additional fields
-- e.g. "where used" add the name of the child spec
- dialog sizing not smart - will fix

<td><pre>Add code completion to ProgCode code field with special handling for tab key so you can still
tab to other fields when the tab doesn't make sense for code completion
- To ensure proper handling of tab in dialog fields and not break tab behavior in inline code
I needed to know where the completer was being used but the MemberDef information was only
on taiWidgetField and not the parent class taiWidgetText - thus the moving up of that info
to the higher class
- Also added an enum to distinguish the type of completer and this opens the door for extension
to completers for fields that are not code expressions
- Will next be adding a directive to specify fields that get completers - functionality will remain as it is

to select the item AND ALSO  open the program editor

<td><pre>Experiment to resolve bug 3000 - clicking in program element clears text
- The problem is that the code "il-&gt;init_start_kill" in the creation of the iTreeWidgetDefaultDelegate
is true when it should be false.
- And it looks like it is true because after editing it isn't getting set to false because
iTreeWidget::itemWasEdited isn't getting called --  iTreeView::itemWasEdited is getting called on an object
that is an iTreeWidget so this is a little puzzling.
- Experiment is to called inherited::itemWasEdited at the beginning of the iTreeView method
- But was is causing this change in behavior I don't yet know

* MAJOR change in naming of ControlPanelMember / Method (was EditMbrItem, EditMthItem), and consolidated all data in a single "data" member with a local type enum that determines what kinds of data are relevant.
* no major functional changes, just cleanup and reorg - relatively little testing though fact
that it complies and various projects load properly is a good sign.  need to test param searching mainly.
* did change saved_value to be editable, per discussion about using ParamSet for configs
* once this is more thoroughly tested, everyone in lab should upgrade at same time b/c not backward compatible.

:* code much cleaner and updated to control panel instead of SelectEdit
:* renamed ControlPanel methods: SelectMember -&gt; AddMember; RemoveField -&gt; RemoveMember, Fun -&gt; Method
:* ability to add to group is really nice for ParamStep / ParamSeq -- also ability to directly edit saved_values there.
:* adding a new ParamSet item auto sets saved_value to current
:* ControlPanelMember does SetCtrlType on InitLinks -- should always be accurate now

<td><pre>* Major cleanup of ControlPanel label / desc code
:* cust_* flags are saved (wasn't saving cust_label) and determine whether you get the default label or not, absolutely.  logic was previously very complex..
:* initial construction sets flags, from there it is up to subsequent edits or user control
:* added short_label arg and option in context menu to create items using short labels = just name of object w/out leading paths
:* general cleanup of api: had taBase methods called xxxLabel and xxxText -- not clear what
diff was -- now separately get Label and Desc defaults..
:* taiArgTypeOfMethodPtr was not getting actual type of obj -- now fixed.
* Added methods to copy Control Panels To / From DataTable's.
:* can now copy entire group of control panels from a ConfigTable in one menu action -- just need to configure first control panel to point to relevant vars using same names as columns of table, then do CopyFromDataTable in controlpanel_group menu, et viola!
:* this is then greatly simplifies converting projects over to new ParamSet structure instead of ConfigTable
:* still need code for saving params from linked param set guys, etc..

<td><pre>oreilly</pre></td>
<td><pre>* Major fix to Variant::isNumeric for String type -- was not using proper logic for bitwise
variables and m_is_numeric_valid was not registering properly -- AND it was using QString::toDouble(&amp;ok) to check if a string was a valid number, BUT that doesn't work for
the C locale, which is our default (and only I think now!?) locale, so now using our
own taString isFloat routine.
* major impliciation of above was inability to properly set enum values from variant strings -- it thought all strings were numbers and would just set to toInt() value which then
leads to everything being a 0.  BUT you do have to check if a valid string-based number rep
instead of a label.. so above fix was key.
* switched control panel from args to use strings directly, instead of going through variant
-- SetCurValFmString -- also handles info about setting and adds a warning if cur string of value != string rep used to set value!  should make bugs easier to see in future.
* switched LeabraFlex over to the new ParamSet version -- param set pointers live in MasterTrain, for interactive running, but are accessed in MasterStartup -- overall this whole setup seems very clean
* added a BUTTON interface for ComparePeers on ParamSet

you just cannot stop yourself from implementing it!
* #SCOPE_ON_xxx option for taBase* members (token pointer members) -- if xxx is another taBase* then it uses that object to scope the items shown in the dialog..  also supports xxx
being a TypeDef*, and allows other #SCOPE options as backup if member pointer is null
* taiWidgetTokenChooser has scope_obj and associated logic to use it to scope by a
specific object -- uses taBase::IsChildOf 
* ProgVar now has an object_scope member that uses above logic -- user can set this to point
to e.g., a group or any object in the hierarchy that contains the objects you want the user
to be able to select for this object* variable -- this will be useful for lots of thigns
but immediately useful for selecting ParamSet* options in LeabraFlex
* group objects were showing up with empty names in chooser for object_scope -- turns out obscure old BugId:1298 had turned them off -- turning back on names -- might fix some
other cases we never noticed before, or might break something.. doesn't break the case
for the original 1298 bug because we now name all our member groups automatically..
* DynEnum was NOT returning the ProgVar description for control panel members -- does now.
* dwt changes are typically tiny (esp in Leabra) -- need to have auto scale button on by default in NetView -- new #AUTO_SCALE setting on connection members now in place to set this on by default -- conveniently works wherever you haven't set anything before, i.e., it seems to fix most of the textbook projects for example.
* css console window is STILL getting some kind of weird Max resize signal and restoring
at maximum size -- now specifically prevent this from happening, and issue a message when
wd &amp; ht are both &gt; 0.8 -- you really don't want to save the console window that big anyway. btw it seems to occur with secondary monitors.

<td><pre>* using actual name of group / list objects reveals that Function's are not naming
their args or fun_code properly.  this is due to ProgEl inheriting from taOBase and
not taNBase, so it didn't get the AutoNameMyMembers call, and it was ALSO not using
the TA-based auto InitLinks -- should definitely always use that where possible!!
* Fixing this then caused Functions to not auto-expand properly in program editor.  this
is because their now properly-named "args" list was actually catching the args pref setting
and that said "don't expand".  Due to the use of global "cur_exapnd_depth" in void iPanelOfProgram::items_CustomExpandFilter and lack of any specific setting for "fun_code"
List, the args setting just carried on for everything thereafter.
* My quick fix was to detect when we get the "fun_code" member and replace it with
"functions" which is listed in the prefs, and is the appropriate setting presumably.
* In general expansion MIGHT be more robust if some kind of stack on cur_expand_depth value
was used so that when you pop out of a nesting level you get back to the expand depth
that was active for that level.  this would entail a simple int_Array which stores
depths as a function of "level" param.  But debugging this is beyond me right now..

directories and none of our projects call any GetPath functions.

default for non-streaming path values for GetValStr methods
:* tabMisc::RootFindFromPath -- use this for most path decoding -- key feature is that it
automatically handles project-relative paths, using taProject::cur_proj current project pointer, while also allowing root-based paths that start with .projects..

existing ProjDirToCurrent methods) based on gui, Program updates.

read-only -- false by default.

search, and this is all you probably need..

<td><pre>Move SVN update for ClusterRun into a background thread.

When you hit update in ClusterRun, this now spawns a background thread, that goes out and does an svn update
on the local svn working directory. Once that svn update has finished, it signals the main gui thread to then
reload all of the clusterrun tables from local disk.

It also issues a UrlExists on the repository in the gui thread first, to ensure that svn has the neccessary credentials
to access the repositories, as opening a password dialog in the background thread does not work.

This commit only moves the update into the background thread, i.e. all write operations, including the write of "Update Running"
still remain syncronous. Also the initial check for access in the first time hitting "Update" after emergent starts will be syncronous.

So this commit does not eliminate all beachballing in ClusterRun, but should help the most significant and noticeable ones.

As updates now happen in the background, if the "Update Running" stops beachballing, it does not mean the operation is complete
and the data is available for "Load Data". It only means it has written the command to run "Update running" on the backend into the
repository. To see when the update running is actually complete, one needs to look at the SVN cur_svn_rev number of when the upgrade succeeded.

(AddArgs.., SetArgs..) instead of generating all the code in css --
key change is that you ONLY need to add a top-level ClusterRun and any linked control
panels from there will automatically be parsed for args.  it is also possible to restrict
args to active_only in the methods but this is off by default, and not exposed in the
ProgEl b/c it doesn't seem like we'll need it..
* Existing projects can now remove redundant ControlPanelsFmArgs calls in MasterStartup -- only retain the one for ClusterRun.
* added ITEM_FILTER to all ControlPanel* arg methods, to only show relevant control panels
(no clones, no archives, no ParamSet for adding methods)
* added support for #CAT_IGNORE -- all gui choosers and doc generation will ignore this
method, but it will still exist in the type-access system as needed for various internal
methods -- good for call-back kinds of methods that need to be in ta..
* fixed taArgtypeOfMemberPtr to use actual current type of object -- had fixed MethdodPtr
previously..

methods

how to set the initial default selection
* method args and member pointers have different logic -- new PREFER_ITEM and PREFER_NULL flags and logic give full control over that, and finally allow methods to select more
sensible defaults while also not auto-setting member variables.
* also major cleanup to the presentation of items in broad token lists, such as in
object_scope in progvar -- turns out we only want to present items that are owned by
a list!  otherwise, they are members and not something we want to be selecting
indpendently.  That plus a NO_TOKEN_CHOOSER object flag (which only applies to

<td><pre>Run an svn cleanup when we start the cluster run server script.

For one, it might be that we need to restart the cluster run script, because it previously crashed and left the svn repository in a locked state

However, the cluster_run svn directory can also accululate a huge amount of cruft in the .svn directory that we need to periodically cleanup.

The .svn directory appears to have a complete copy of everything. But unlike the main version, if one deletes files with svn rm, they don't seem
to get deleted from the .svn copy until one runs a svn cleanup. This led to e.g on cluster run directory shrinking from 70GB to 3 GB after running an svn cleanup

<td><pre>MAJOR CHANGE in TA type system: TypeDef now keeps a separate list of static_members!
* it just doesn't make sense to have members and static members all mixed up in the
same list -- I almost always forget to filter out static members from code where they
should definitely be excluded, because I just don't think about them.  and they cause
so many potential subtle and hard-to-recognize problems when they are improperly operated
on as regular members.
* As this is such a major change to fundamental infrastructure, it is likely that some kinds
of bugs will be introduced even as others are eliminated..  I have only done basic testing
at this point, so we'll see what Jenkins turns up, and further running etc.  Be on the
lookout and file anything you find!
* The new default behavior is to not save or edit static members.  taMisc and taMath have
the new ##STATIC_MEMBERS directive to override this behavior for them.  there is a
new check in ta_type_constr when building type data that makes sure any static members
are marked as #NO_SAVE and #HIDDEN -- this was already true of most cases, but a few
random cases didn't have that -- now fixed -- even though it doesn't actually matter anymore!
The point in keeping that and checking still is to ensure that this behavior is
acknowledged by the programmer, so it doesn't just slip under the radar..
* updated css core code to look in static_members in addition to members, but there could
be some strange css cases that don't work possibly still..

The computing resources are provided by the Neuroscience Gateway portal ( https://www.nsgportal.org/ ) under an NSF grant.

The resources are available for people to more easily perform research in computational neuroscience and Emergent is hopefully
going to be one of the computational neuroscience tools they offer and support.

By including the configuration of this cluster in emergent, this allows to simplify the setup of its usage for new users.

The needed repository for the cluster_run is hosted on grey (clusterun_public), and users need to obtain an svn username and password
in order to ensure accountability for computing resources, by emailing.

More information about this public resource will become available under https://grey.colorado.edu/emergent/index.php/NSG_public

* YOU MUST DO A: ./reconfigure build[_dbg] clean to rebuild with this!!  need to
force maketa to redo everything -- it requires a complete rebuild in any case..
* This has been superficially tested on our major projects (bvPVLV, lvis) and seems to
work, including save / load / save / load cycles etc.  BUT, recommend not updating
for everyone until a bit more testing by the brave.. :)
* Version bumped to 8.0.8 in recognition of irreversable changes in file formats!
* many classes were marked as only INLINE but not INLINE_DUMP -- now INLINE implies
both EDIT_INLINE and SAVE_INLINE -- INLINE_DUMP no longer valid (err will trigger) -- if
you want one or the other, just specify them separately.  many classes that can be
effectively saved inline are now doing so, but the save format cannot go back to
inline after being non-inline (probably that is fixable too... but for now..) so
that is why the file formats are incompatible.
* NO_SHOW is not allowed anymore -- it is HIDDEN!
* changed order of tree options -- now TREE_HIDDEN and TREE_SHOW -- rules for these
updated on wiki.
* got rid of "show" menu and associated very complex logic that likely
caused crashing etc -- new dialogs with expert, hidden sections handle that fine.
now there is just one simple set of rules that apply for all time about what is
visible in an edit dialog, where, etc.  you can just read the code and see what
is going on.  also Hidden section now shows everything that was hidden, including
READ_ONLY..
* inline classes never show EXPERT members.  but they will show up in docs or if you
view the object itself directly so still kinda ok to keep that option.
* major visibility options are now cached in MemberDefBase opt_flags -- use the
HasXXX and IsXXX methods to query these!  all existing code updated.  much more
efficient and easier to type etc.  especially for large-scale traverses of the
tree..
* Wiki docs updated with all current comment directive logic.
* saving and loading of INLINE classes is now robust to " } ; in strings!  this was NOT
the case previously -- core parsing routines upgraded to skip things in quotes too
so everything should be more robust.
* added UpdateAll methods that traverse tree and update *everything* -- will use
for Patch now, and then try to replace update after loading code.
* fixed spurious warning about master and clones during destroy
* Important fix to Function -- it already had a name and yet inherited from ProgEl which
got a new name -- now properly replaces that functionality.  not sure how it
even worked ok in prior checkin..

projects saved with a version between then and now must be reverted to a prior revision,
then should be safe to load / save using this version and beyond!
* main save code now consistently uses taString::quote_esc / unesc, for both inline
and non-inline strings, with backward compatibility for anything prior to 8.0.8 to
only unescape the non-inline strings.
:* NOTE: did NOT include convoluted case of projects saved with the double escaping for the small window of r10689 to now.. overall much safer to just revert because some of the
escaping might have been recursively over-escaping etc.
* rewrote taString::quote_esc / unesc to be a simpler faster monolithic function NOT using
multiple gsubs, which might not have worked properly always -- also don't esc / unesc other
whitespace -- this is just about the quotes.  fully tested with horrible strings!
* reverted all the main project files affected by this.
* noticed that LeabraFlex had some weird non-standard params -- act.gain = 20, etc --
not sure how that happened!  could explain slower learning.
* updated defaults for margin params in LeabraLayerSpec

fixed those yet -- next -- but the escaping business should hopefully be ok..

<td><pre>* Yet another major fix to dump file saving -- just when I thought I could rest easy...
patch files were setting pointers to objects in other projects, depending on project
that was source of patch relative to where it was being applied.  bottom line: dump
file should NOT use absolute root-relatives paths!  the existing path fixing
mechanisms for this only work when the paths to be fixed are fully within the
loaded object, but with patches you're loading objects with pointers to other things
outside of the current patch..
* Fortunately, it was relatively easy to fix everything to save paths relative first
to the object being saved, or, failing that, to the project, and, only failing that,
to the root.  loading obeys the same logic.  just some bit of difficulty with links
as in sending projections.. now working.
* extra bonus: files are smaller yet again..
* I will bump the version to 8.0.9 on next checkin -- should have done that this time.
* definitely tested on many cases including patches and everything seems to work!
* also fixed some issues with patches, and regenerated the main 8.0.4 to 8.1.0
LeabraFlex one, for the nth time..

gating signal look at this for updating their own act_g gating-time activation 
* CRITICAL fix to several cases where values were being sent and used during the
same stage of Cycle_Run updating!  This was across multiple PVLV and PBWM cases..
:* New absolute standard is that all modulatory values are sent during Compute_Act_Post
and consumed on the NEXT cycle, BEFORE Act_Post updates them again!
:* Required Patch to now send shunt activation value which recv MSN's use on next
cycle to modulate da and ach, instead of Patch directly doing it.

<td><pre>Fix for	3400 - Next logical tree node not selected on tree node	delete
- Clearly this worked at some point because the	logic is in iTreeView::ItemDestroyingCb
but some changes have meant that by the time the method is called the TreeItem no longer
has a pointer to the TreeView and the code doesn't get executed.
- I borrowed the logic from the method and added a public method that selects the next logical item
and also calls BrowserSelectMe so that the item is actually focused but the method  doesn't call Remove
because the previous method calls take() anyway.
- Looks like ItemDestroyingCb is a no-op at this point
- Heavily tested -- works well in all cases other than deletion of group item so a bit more to do
- Fast deletion generates the "Attempt to add a SigLinkClient to a destructing object" warning so that
is working well.

I was using the unfiltered mode after spaces, parens, etc. That is, in places where there is no basis for filtering.
It seems that I can leave the completer in filtered mode and still get the unfiltered list.
Only the situations with the unfiltered list (like after "if(" ) had the return select problem.
