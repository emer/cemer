The values of EarQ and minBW come from Moore and Glasberg's paperdefining the ERB. Those values, when used in their formula for ERB, givethe auditory bandwidth as a function of frequency for a normal-hearinglistener: 	erb=6.23*f0*f0 + 93.39*f0 + 28.52; %ERB in Hz from Moore andGlasberg (1983),where f0 is the band center frequency in kHz. An approximation is:	erb=minBW*(EarQ*f0 + 1.0);The routine from Malcolm Slaney starts with the ERB as a function offrequency, and then computes the center frequencies for a set of filterslocated at uniform spacing on an ERB frequency scale.
