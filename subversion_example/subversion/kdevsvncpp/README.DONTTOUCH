Do _NOT_ touch any of these files unless you know what you're doing. This is a
copy of the rapidsvn svncpp library imported because we need to make some minor
changes to use it in kdevelop.

I repeat: Do _not_ change any of these files with things like
spelling-mistakes, s/FALSE/false or commenting out unused parameters. That
makes updating to a newer svncpp version a lot harder and any such changes will
be reverted.
