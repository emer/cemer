  The clipboard/Drag-Drop model involves single or lists of data items that can be
  transferred to/from the clipboard, or transfered via drag/drop (dragdrop is mostly the
  same as clipboard, so unless otherwise noted, dd is assumed in clipboard.) Both in-process
  (inside one instance) as well as external (across instances) operations are supported.
  The system accommodates generic clipboard data (text, image, etc.), but is primarily for
  dealing with "tacss" objects, which are objects understood by the TA/CSS base system. A
  restriction of the tacss system is that every data item involved needs to have a TypeDef
  object -- if externally supplied classes must be handled, then a small wrapper class must
  be created to do the transfer.

  The clipboard facility requires the following services by the qtclipdata system:
    * taking one or more input data items, and providing a single clipboard representation
    * taking a clipboard contents, and extracting the descriptions of data being supplied
    * obtaining the actual data (ex. text stream rep) of a data item being supplied
    * communicating to a source when a data item has been taken (ex. Cut/Paste)

  A single data item is encapsulated in a taiMimeItem object for both source (i.e. to
  clipboard) and destination (i.e. from clipboard) operations.
  The member properties are (s-sending, r-receiving):
    obj -- (s/r*) the object (* r-obj only possible in-process)
    type - (s/r*) the TypeDef of the object (* r-type only possible between commensural app,
       instances, ex. leabra++ <-> leabra++, but (sometimes) not leabra++ <-> bp++)
    rep -- (s/r) the data representation, ex. a dump text stream

    typename -- (d) the type of the object
    path -- (d) the full path of the object

  The source operations are:
    * new(data item) -- creates a new sending instance (there can be multiple variants of this)
    * setDesc -- sets the desc needed for the clipboard (ex. by typename and path)
    * setData -- sets the data needed for the clipboard (ex. by dumping object to a text stream)
  The destination operations are:
    * create(data rep)
    * query -- determine the type of object, etc.
    * getDesc -- gets the desc data needed to characterize the object (ex. typename and path)
    * getData -- get the streamed data of the object (note: usually only used for external objects)
    * notifyTaken -- notifies the source that Cut/Moved data was taken

  Emergent supplies clipboard data as follows:
  Higher level objects may also supply a graphical image (ex. image of the network.)

  MIME TYPE "tacss/common" -- common header info for any tacss items

    There is only one of these, regardless of whatever other formats are included
      <src edit action>;<process id>;
      
    <src edit action> -- enables us to differentiate between a Cut and a
      Copied object (these flags are NOT used for drag and drop, 
      since the dest determines whether it is a DragMove or a DragCopy
      operation)
    <process id> -- the process id of source; lets us differentiate between
      data that comes from our own internal instance, vs. an external instance
      (note: Mac only allows one instance, so there are never out-of-process
       operations on the Mac.)

  MIME TYPE "tacss/objectdesc" -- compact description of data (no content)

    The data is a list of object descriptors, as follows:
      <item count N>;\n
      [<typename>;<pdp path of object>[;<optional extended data>]*\n]xN

    There is one type/path line per object. 

  MIME TYPE "tacss/objectdata;index=<i>" 0 <= i < N

    The data is the rep (ext dump save text) of the object.

  MIME TYPE "text/plain"
    
    taccs/objectdesc
      The same string as the objectdesc string (primarily for diagnostic purposes).
      
iClipData -- sender

  iClipData is the class used by senders to supply tacss data to the clipboard system.
  This class is derived from QMimeData, and so inherently supports Drap/Drop, and clipboard
  operations.

  This class uses taiClipSrc

To Extend taiMimeSource:

  (1) extend formats_impl() override, check for your own indexes, else delegate to baseclass
