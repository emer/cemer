//      iSynchronousNetRequest      //
/////////////////////////////////////

// Implementation notes
//
// Each QNetworkAccessManager (QNAM) object has its own cookiejar, proxy
// settings, etc.  A global QNAM object (taiMisc::net_access_mgr) is already
// created for the Webkit stuff.  That QNAM is really an instance of
// iNetworkAccessManager, which has code to manage authentications, SSL
// errors, and (potentially) proxies.  A new cookie jar is created and given
// to net_access_mgr when it is created.
//
// Code in this file could potentially use the same QNAM or create its own.
// Originally (pre r5613), it was using the net_access_mgr QNAM object and
// connecting directly to the finished() signal as so:
//   QObject::connect(taiMisc::net_access_mgr, SIGNAL(finished(QNetworkReply*)),
//                    read_ready, SLOT(finished(QNetworkReply*)));
//
// That isn't viable since every webkit operation would inadvertently trigger
// read_ready's finished() slot.  iSynchronousNetRequest was created with its
// own QNAM to avoid such problems, but after a few design iterations there
// was no longer any need to connect slots at all -- the "wait" function
// essentially polled the QNetworkReply's isFinished() function until the
// operation was complete, failed, or was cancelled.  This code was checked
// in as r5613 and worked well for simple query operations like searching,
// where no authentication or login was required.
//
// However, there are disadvantages to using a separate QNAM.  Each QNAM
// manages its own cookies and authentications, so a user would have to
// provide credentials for emergent's webkit browser, then provide them again
// to use this class's APIs.  The icookiejar.h and inetworkaccessmanager.h
// files save cookies and authentications to disk in a user's "local app data"
// folder (e.g., C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\emergent on Windows).  With
// multiple QNAMs, each would write data to this store, clobbering the others.
//
// Sharing a cookie jar is a potentially fragile option -- documentation for
// QNetworkAccessManager::setCookieJar() says:
//   http://doc.qt.digia.com/4.7-snapshot/qnetworkaccessmanager.html
//   If cookieJar is in the same thread as this QNetworkAccessManager,
//   it will set the parent of the cookieJar so that the cookie jar is
//   deleted when this object is deleted as well. If you want to share
//   cookie jars between different QNetworkAccessManager objects, you
//   may want to set the cookie jar's parent to 0 after calling this
//   function.
//
// It seems like a better option is to share a QNAM instead, and if there's
// need to connect signals, connect them to the QNetworkReply object instead
// of to the QNAM object.  That option is recommended here:
//   http://www.johanpaul.com/blog/2011/07/why-qnetworkaccessmanager-should-not-have-the-finishedqnetworkreply-signal/
//   My guess is that the finished(QNetworkReply *) signal in
//   QNetworkAccessManager is there for the sake of convenience.
//   It's an obvious place to put a finished signal for a request
//   that the manager does. But it can be dangerous too since you
//   will probably use just one QNetworkAccessManager in your
//   application which means that it cannot bind directly to your
//   application states.
//
// The r5613 commit checkpointed the initial (working) implementation of
// iSynchronousNetRequest before migrating to a scheme that shares the QNAM
// created for Webkit (r5616).
