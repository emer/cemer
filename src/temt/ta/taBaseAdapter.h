/*
 * taBaseAdapter enables a taOBase object to handle Qt events, via a
 * proxy(taBaseAdapter)/stub(taBase) approach. Note that dual-parenting a taBase object
 * with QObject is not workable, because QObject must come first, and then all the (taBase*)(void*)
 * casts in the system break...

 * To use, subclass taBaseAdapter when events need to be handled. Create the instance in
 * the Initialize() call and set with SetAdapter. The adapter object does not participate
 * in copying/cloning/etc. (it has no state information).

 * Since classes can have subclasses, there may be successive calls to Initialize with subclasses
 * of an adapter. The adapters will be chained, with the new adapter becoming the QObject parent of
 * the previous adapter. Therefore, when the current adapter is destroyed, child adapters will also
 * get destroyed. It will not matter whether a base class hooks to its own adapter, or to a subclass
 * or to a combination.
