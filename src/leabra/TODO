leabra todo list:

* programs: add epoch-level monitor, rename data as TrialMonitor and EpochMonitor

* change scope to #PROGRAM for vars in callmethod; add a link to global_vars in program
so it finds it

* need pointer converter for Program copy: anything that refers to a var etc within
 a program needs to be updated..

* wizards: reactivate env making stuff -- makes life easier -- and simple procs??

* something funky about converted networks.. save & rebuild works but initial one does not..

---

* datatable aggregation

* create MathFuns library with all kinds of math-related things in it, incl lots of #CAT
docs..

* deal with small-batch weight updates
* deal with dmem: network counters aggregate across epoch.. rndseed aggregate, etc

* add #CAT to everything in netstru and leabra.h, and fixup comments

* bugs: network display updates at start of trial with weird state info, despite wrap
  by DataUpdate guys, etc
* profile: slow!!!
