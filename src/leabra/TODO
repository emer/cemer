leabra todo list:

------------------
hv model

bugs:
netmon: names for net vars getting network name
network: train_mode comment = t -- fix

* add retinal scaling + args
* add attention bubble for plain filter
* rename foveate -> foveate_box etc (always box)
* do repeat testing
* show retina stuff in netview (record params in trial log to)
  
* make 2x retina with same filts (really big net)

* train model to identify location of key target:
  CHL:
  minus phase is where looking now; plus is where next
  if correct recognition on plus, then it serves to train, else not!
  MINUS_MINUS_PLUS or prev MINUS vs this PLUS with repetition of
  same item

  RL:
  spatial system on t-1 decides where to look at t
  if model recognizes object at t, pvlv gets reward
  cs association with good look decisions drives reward at t-1


------------------
* netview: 
  * save view state in top-level view guy (camera)
  * netview xform for whole network + dragger etc

* gridview: unitize + global xform, have obj per column so you can click (maybe just header?),
  auto-size blocks, fix auto-scale, 4dim unit display

  - test case: filtered layer unit history moving back in depth w/ netview

* datatable: row manip functions like rowcopy, moverow, insert row, etc
  * add DataGetCurRowVars -- just like data calc loop var getter -- use in applyimage
  * concat columns
  * datatable time average

* v3convert: end up with 2 bias.unit links from copy op?

* css: p voidfun = crash; bindargs seems to not be getting the void??
  e.g., p taMisc::include_paths.List();

* replace condlist with datatables -- just do all the ops on the datatables 
  directly; lots of datatableloops!

-----------
Program issues

css:

* css_console.cpp: complete obj.mbr expressions..

-----------
Check:

-----------
Broader issues:

* configuring network properties: currently various button menus but need more efficient?

-----------
current bugs:



-------
lower pri:

* add #CAT to everything in leabra_*.h, and fixup comments

* checkconfig on functions -- fun can only appear in functions (but not vice-versa..)

* test FILE string_stream.css: ptr = 0?

----------
arg directives

----------
Not sure if still an issue:

* LayerSpec CheckConfig needs to test for existence of units before doing Leaf();?
* need state flag for changing type: don't try to replace spec pointers on cutlinks.
