leabra todo list:

* ta_dataanal.h: add taDataAnal guy with SVD/ etc as applied to DataTable:
  * distance matrix, (also on math) that gets frames and does it on those
  * eigen on what??  correl matrix?
  * get all from env
  
* dataops: random patterns!

* mathfuns: add all float_RArray funs, for matricies.

* dataproc duplicate rows

* css: p voidfun = crash; bindargs seems to not be getting the void??
  e.g., p taMisc::include_paths.List();

Broader issues:

lower pri:

* add #CAT to everything in leabra_*.h, and fixup comments

* checkconfig on functions -- fun can only appear in functions (but not vice-versa..)

* test FILE string_stream.css: ptr = 0?

arg directives

Not sure if still an issue:

* LayerSpec CheckConfig needs to test for existence of units before doing Leaf();?
* need state flag for changing type: don't try to replace spec pointers on cutlinks.
