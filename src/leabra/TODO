leabra todo list:

* SaveNetwork[Weights] program -- uses above (needs taMisc call -- in leabra_ra)

* change WriteWeights etc to take String arg + getfile stuff -- need a coherent strategy
  on this: regular visible fun takes fname arg, _strm takes the stream arg..
  change this for all ta_base !!?

* fix c_String conversion to -> ostream*

* extrew in trial monitor seems not to be working: 12ax demo
* change gp name to include unique ctr so group fun works.

* relnet stat

* create MathFuns library with all kinds of math-related things in it, incl lots of #CAT
docs..: add all float_RArray funs, for matricies.

-----------
Program issues

* checkconfig on functions -- fun can only appear in functions (but not vice-versa..)
* fix String name arg -- should work -- find parse class

* for enum args, add TypeName:: to def arg in methodcall
* use taMisc::prog_lib_paths directly instead of separate one in proglib, and use
  the name labels so they show up in chooser..

css:
* syntax error ^ doesn't show up in right place..

-----------
current bugs:


-------
lower pri:

* more color highlighting in general of programs?

* css_console.cpp: complete obj.mbr expressions..

* add MEDIAN, MODE, FIRST, LAST, to vec_ and Aggregate; mv agg to appropriate place

* add SVD/Eigenvec etc to math and then as data ops and dataprog's

* datachanged for obj -> update corresp var; datachanged goes to obj_list --
  need hook in there, but it is a generic list..

* test FILE string_stream.css: ptr = 0?

---
* deal with small-batch weight updates
* deal with dmem: network counters aggregate across epoch.. rndseed aggregate, etc

* add #CAT to everything in netstru and leabra.h, and fixup comments

----------
arg directives

----------
Not sure if still an issue:

* LayerSpec CheckConfig needs to test for existence of units before doing Leaf();?
* need state flag for changing type: don't try to replace spec pointers on cutlinks.
