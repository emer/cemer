 -- names in val_specs should come from parent object..  don't mod based on var name either
-- #NO_BROWSE on val_specs either

* layerwriter trial_name and group_name not reliable either..
* not reading ktwa specs properly from v3

* indicate in proglib name if it is a group or just one guy: LeabraAll_Std, etc..
* fix names: Grouped -> GpData

-----
