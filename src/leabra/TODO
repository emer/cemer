leabra todo list:

* qconsole: can still cursor backwards past prompt (left arrow, etc). fix!

* dataops: group mean/sse: int columns not being processed properly: convert to double?
  also support float
  also check on matrix data: does it just work?

* scan_congroups in netdata netmonitor -- not getting sending layer geom.
  do quick try at this

* dataops: random patterns!

* relnet stat & adaptation of lay act_pct and wtscale.

* create MathFuns library with all kinds of math-related things in it, incl lots of #CAT
docs..: add all float_RArray funs, for matricies.

* add #CAT to everything in leabra.h, and fixup comments

-----------
Program issues

css:

* css_console.cpp: complete obj.mbr expressions..

-----------
Check:

* pbatch & same-seed batch

* extrew in trial monitor seems not to be working: 12ax demo
* 12ax: change gp name to include unique ctr so group fun works.

* datatable - make unique col names; call for join op..

-----------
Broader issues:

* configuring network properties: currently various button menus but need more efficient?

-----------
current bugs:

* copy of layerspec is not getting LeabraLayerSpec::compute_i properly!


-------
lower pri:

* checkconfig on functions -- fun can only appear in functions (but not vice-versa..)

* more color highlighting in general of programs?

* add MEDIAN, MODE, FIRST, LAST, to vec_ and Aggregate; mv agg to appropriate place

* add SVD/Eigenvec etc to math and then as data ops and dataprog's

* test FILE string_stream.css: ptr = 0?

----------
arg directives

----------
Not sure if still an issue:

* LayerSpec CheckConfig needs to test for existence of units before doing Leaf();?
* need state flag for changing type: don't try to replace spec pointers on cutlinks.
