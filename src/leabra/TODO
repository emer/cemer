leabra todo list:

commit:

------------------
* gridview: unitize + global xform, have obj per column so you can click (maybe just header?),
  auto-size blocks, fix auto-scale, 4dim unit display

  * count image as 1x1 for display purposes -- is rescaled anyway?
  * font computation not working for # of chars to display (too conservative)

  - test case: filtered layer unit history moving back in depth w/ netview

  - why doesn't gridview update with WriteClose()?

------------------
hv model

* debug DMEM timing: add start/end timer with some flags on the control guy and use
for setting network stats vars on dmem_timing.

* IT fm output: adapt goes up to .12, no adapt is down at .018 -- change it fm output target.
  itfmo05

* output should get more from IT than V4??  check wiki for prior experiments..


* do repeat testing
* show retina stuff in netview (record params in trial log to)
 
* train model to identify location of key target:
  CHL:
  minus phase is where looking now; plus is where next
  if correct recognition on plus, then it serves to train, else not!
  MINUS_MINUS_PLUS or prev MINUS vs this PLUS with repetition of
  same item

  RL:
  spatial system on t-1 decides where to look at t
  if model recognizes object at t, pvlv gets reward
  cs association with good look decisions drives reward at t-1


--------------------
* netview: 

 * make xydrag handles thicker: create new default image by replacing existing
   with thicker bars; also for transform box

* set disabled flag from layer.lesion (highlighting)

--------------

* datatable: row manip functions like rowcopy, moverow, insert row, etc
  * add DataGetCurRowVars -- just like data calc loop var getter -- use in applyimage
  * concat columns
  * datatable time average

* ta_math: convolve; gaussian/uniform gen; time averaging with diff kernels

* v3convert: end up with 2 bias.unit links from copy op?

* css: p voidfun = crash; bindargs seems to not be getting the void??
  e.g., p taMisc::include_paths.List();
  css include path & files from old css..

* replace condlist with datatables -- just do all the ops on the datatables 
  directly; lots of datatableloops!

-----------
Program issues

* proglib: add dates!

* edit user script: non-modal dialog w/ better (narrower) default sizing

css:

* css_console.cpp: complete obj.mbr expressions..

-----------
Check:

-----------
Broader issues:

* configuring network properties: currently various button menus but need more efficient?

-----------
current bugs:



-------
lower pri:

* add #CAT to everything in leabra_*.h, and fixup comments

* checkconfig on functions -- fun can only appear in functions (but not vice-versa..)

* test FILE string_stream.css: ptr = 0?

----------
arg directives
