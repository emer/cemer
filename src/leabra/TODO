leabra todo list:

* nuke float_RArray totally: fun lookup

* create MathFuns library with all kinds of math-related things in it, incl lots of #CAT
docs..: add all float_RArray funs, for matricies.

* extrew in trial monitor seems not to be working: 12ax demo

* relnet stat

* startup script

---------

current bugs:

* trim Item Detail in progeditor if > 50 or so..

* autobuild etc -- this stuff needs to be in dump_load because it is not called
  during load from project_group..

* not reading last col & row of test.dat!

--------
check:

* auto-build network upon loading flag (with prompt option!)

* add avg_cycles to network, monitor


-------
lower pri:

* add "print" Progel?

* css_console.cpp: complete obj.mbr expressions..

* add MEDIAN, MODE, FIRST, LAST, to vec_ and Aggregate; mv agg to appropriate place

* add SVD/Eigenvec etc to math and then as data ops and dataprog's

* datachanged for obj -> update corresp var; datachanged goes to obj_list --
  need hook in there, but it is a generic list..

* test FILE string_stream.css: ptr = 0?

---
* deal with small-batch weight updates
* deal with dmem: network counters aggregate across epoch.. rndseed aggregate, etc

* add #CAT to everything in netstru and leabra.h, and fixup comments

----------
arg directives

----------
Not sure if still an issue:

* LayerSpec CheckConfig needs to test for existence of units before doing Leaf();?
* need state flag for changing type: don't try to replace spec pointers on cutlinks.
