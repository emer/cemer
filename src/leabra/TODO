leabra todo list:

commit:

* fixed ProgExpr path parse bug [ ]

------------
current:

* clearer if DynEnum type and token are separate..  Brad was right.  Dynenum edit not working.

* CHECK: add DataUpdate brackets in Filter op -- still doesn't fix problem!

* program SetVar should operate on the progvar and not on the underlying css guy -- then
  it doesn't matter when it is called relative to Init, etc

* VarInc, VarDec (var++, var--) -- can be useful

* progexpr not finding variables in function args

* NewLayer not working in netview

* graph axis units not good; also add label of data column
* bar graph mode??  -- easy to do.. just do it..  no fill..

* multi-test on hv

* Add switch case guy: n_cases = enforced number of progels in case_code,
  ProgExpr_List size -- use a CodeBlock for more guys!

* Program Init logic: do CheckConfig *after* Init function runs!?

---

* #ARG_VAL_FM_n_xxx -- get init value of arg from given member (can be a path)
  * ProgEl* fm name!

* ProgVar FLAG: CTRL_RO -- read only in control panel #374

* datatable: 
  * Join should be symmetric
  * add DataGetCurRowVars -- just like data calc loop var getter -- use in applyimage

* leabra inhib: compute distance from "ideal" inhib based on k target netin (e.g., .4)
  and add extra inhib in proportion.  set point in for inhib value itself.  makes the
  weakly activated units more weak, and the strongly activated more weak too!  pop out??

* project display needs update after loading: filename is not there..


-----------
Inventor

* new viewer
* import object files
* render objects to bitmap and use to present to network

-----------
check:

* Init column out of range error in various projects

* check uae on progel paste

* #288: profile check on editing a datatable and then clicking away, for
  sub-rasa updates do dialog -- seems slower after clicking around
  (confirmed).  maybe net too?  STILL NEED THIS -- THIS IS HAPPENING!

------------------
Program issues

* proglib: add dates (fill in!) also fix bug after repeated calls..

--------------------
Other Algorithms:
  * fixup BP, so plugin

--------------

* css include path & files from old css..
* p ((v1 > 0.0) ? (1.0 / v1): 0.0) : gives a div0 error -- should not!
* css #include: make a new codeblock and put all the include stuff in there,
   to get rid of zaplast?  how to best handle?
* css listing is still lame.  maybe just have completely separate global text list, 
  with pointers into that?

------------------
hv model

* move all key db's to programs: makes it more robust
* put code under svn

* document fixes:
* IT fm output: adapt goes up to .12, no adapt is down at .018 -- change it fm output target.
  itfmo05  -- still bust; 
* main thing is high: v2 from v4 seems to be bad..  try run with just norel adapt + output
* output should get more from IT than V4??  check wiki for prior experiments..

* do repeat testing
* show retina stuff in netview (record params in trial log too)

* add 3d model rendering using inventor..
 
* train model to identify location of key target:
  CHL:
  minus phase is where looking now; plus is where next
  if correct recognition on plus, then it serves to train, else not!
  MINUS_MINUS_PLUS or prev MINUS vs this PLUS with repetition of
  same item

  RL:
  spatial system on t-1 decides where to look at t
  if model recognizes object at t, pvlv gets reward
  cs association with good look decisions drives reward at t-1

-----------
css:

* css_console.cpp: complete obj.mbr expressions..

------------------
* datatable views:

  - struct update debug on hv model
  - when editing a datatable_impl, need to send refresh update to display
  - initial panel is not updated..  just stick in render_impl and be done with it??  no..
  - view at is too far zoomed out -- can't seem to fix this at all, any way I try..
  - colorscale changes not sending signal
  - add data_spacing to graph view?

  - all views: add bool for draggers (in gridview; only active for structural re-init)

--------------------
* netview: 

* add 2d text flag for netview. play with complexity vis-a-vis rendering
  (probably not worth it for flag -- costs a lot in render but is not a big
  deal..)

-----------
Check:

-----------
Broader issues:

* configuring network properties: currently various button menus but need more efficient?
* specifically connecting layers!

-----------
current bugs:


---------------
Tom's project:

* replace condlist with datatables -- just do all the ops on the datatables 
  directly; lots of datatableloops!


-------
lower pri:

* cleanup other uses of RunPending -> process events or remove??  test for
  need for css Cont RunPending -- test in hv model.

* add #CAT to everything in leabra_*.h, and fixup comments

* checkconfig on functions -- fun can only appear in functions (but not vice-versa..)

* test FILE string_stream.css: ptr = 0?

* view colors: enum with different built-in styles

* make netview xydrag handles thicker: create new default image by replacing existing
   with thicker bars;

----------
arg directives
