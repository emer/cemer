commit:


------------
current:

* graph symbol size

* add "compute" string field to datatable column + corresponding flag -- have
  a static progspace for datatable and a compute row and compute column and
  table function -- loads in all columns for current row as css hardvars as in
  datacalc and allows you to write exprs in terms of these guys.  every
  writeclose will update computes, in addition to supporting general computation.

* provide direct access somehow to datatable tools.  one idea is to
  auto-populate a new group in project called .data_proc that has all the static
  guys just sitting there..  this is easy enough that I'll just do it.

* program control panel

* init stuff for var objs and Program targets -- make a static special progspace for 
  just this.

* profile  check on editing a datatable and then clicking away, for sub-rasa updates do dialog
  -- seems slower after clicking around (confirmed).  maybe net too?  
  STILL NEED THIS -- THIS IS HAPPENING!

* cleanup other uses of RunPending -> process events or remove??  test for
  need for css Cont RunPending -- test in hv model.

* add 2d text flag for netview. play with complexity vis-a-vis rendering
  (probably not worth it for flag -- costs a lot in render but is not a big
  deal..)

* copying a network: links are not fixed (send_idx, etc)

* saving 12ax model *with* units, then close project: get a crash.  not without. spec.CutLinks

* v3convert: 
  * epoch timer not being set on 12ax convert in epoch mon

* enforce naming rules on layer names, to match data table columns.


check:

* did I ever fix clicking on an axis, etc?  also, deleting an item from a view and
  then selecting something else in the view to delete caused a crash..  CRASHING!

* quit has changes thing, close project does not.. (ticket)

* filer needs to use basic context (ticket filed)
  * tmp name is bizzare -- fname filer issues (ticket)

------------------
Program issues

* proglib: add dates!
* dirty!!

* edit user script: non-modal dialog w/ better (narrower) default sizing

--------------------
Other Algorithms:
  * fixup BP, so plugin

--------------

* datatable: row manip functions like rowcopy, moverow, insert row, etc
  * add DataGetCurRowVars -- just like data calc loop var getter -- use in applyimage
  * concat columns
  * datatable time average

* ta_math: convolve; gaussian/uniform gen; time averaging with diff kernels

* css: p voidfun = crash; bindargs seems to not be getting the void??
  e.g., p taMisc::include_paths.List();
  css include path & files from old css..

------------------
hv model

* debug DMEM timing: add start/end timer with some flags on the control guy and use
for setting network stats vars on dmem_timing.

* IT fm output: adapt goes up to .12, no adapt is down at .018 -- change it fm output target.
  itfmo05  -- still bust; 

* main thing is high: v2 from v4 seems to be bad..  try run with just norel adapt + output

* output should get more from IT than V4??  check wiki for prior experiments..

* do repeat testing
* show retina stuff in netview (record params in trial log to)
 
* train model to identify location of key target:
  CHL:
  minus phase is where looking now; plus is where next
  if correct recognition on plus, then it serves to train, else not!
  MINUS_MINUS_PLUS or prev MINUS vs this PLUS with repetition of
  same item

  RL:
  spatial system on t-1 decides where to look at t
  if model recognizes object at t, pvlv gets reward
  cs association with good look decisions drives reward at t-1

---------------
Tom's project:

* replace condlist with datatables -- just do all the ops on the datatables 
  directly; lots of datatableloops!

-----------
css:

* css_console.cpp: complete obj.mbr expressions..

------------------
* datatable views:

  - struct update debug on hv model
  - when editing a datatable_impl, need to send refresh update to display
  - initial panel is not updated..  just stick in render_impl and be done with it??  no..
  - view at is too far zoomed out -- can't seem to fix this at all, any way I try..
  - colorscale changes not sending signal
  - add data_spacing to graph view?

  - all views: add bool for draggers (in gridview; only active for structural re-init)

--------------------
* netview: 

-----------
Check:

-----------
Broader issues:

* configuring network properties: currently various button menus but need more efficient?
* specifically connecting layers!

-----------
current bugs:



-------
lower pri:

* add #CAT to everything in leabra_*.h, and fixup comments

* checkconfig on functions -- fun can only appear in functions (but not vice-versa..)

* test FILE string_stream.css: ptr = 0?

* view colors: enum with different built-in styles

* make netview xydrag handles thicker: create new default image by replacing existing
   with thicker bars;

----------
arg directives
