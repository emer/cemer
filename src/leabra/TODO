leabra todo list:

commit:


------------
current:

* load/save all prog_lib and testsprojects & test convert

* Netview going to targ instead of act

* Add switch case guy: n_cases = enforced number of progels in case_code,
  ProgExpr_List size -- use a CodeBlock for more guys!

* Program Init logic: do CheckConfig *after* Init function runs!?

* ProgVar FLAG: CTRL_RO -- read only in control panel

* Join should be symmetric

* save recover files in current project dir, with .recover name #255

* have a way to parameterize what program to call???  nah, just make an if,then thing.
  todo: add a switch case..?

* NewLayer not working in netview
* default type not loading (#311)

* #ARG_VAL_FM_n_xxx -- get init value of arg from given member (can be a path)
  * ProgEl* fm name!

* #READ_ONLY -> + #EXPERT for non-system-y type data that contains values you might want 
  to see (esp leabra etc) (revisit Network too)

* datatable: 
  * add DataGetCurRowVars -- just like data calc loop var getter -- use in applyimage

* leabra inhib: compute distance from "ideal" inhib based on k target netin (e.g., .4)
  and add extra inhib in proportion.  set point in for inhib value itself.  makes the
  weakly activated units more weak, and the strongly activated more weak too!  pop out??

* project display needs update after loading: filename is not there..

-----------
Inventor

* new viewer
* import object files
* render objects to bitmap and use to present to network

-----------
check:

* check: DataProg DataTableRef -> ProgVarRef w/ convert

* edit user script: non-modal dialog w/ better (narrower) default sizing
  (add c++ syntax hightight?) #262

* check uae on progel paste

* datatable load not getting file name ext AGAIN!

* convert tmp name is bizzare -- fname filer issues (ticket)

* #288: profile check on editing a datatable and then clicking away, for
  sub-rasa updates do dialog -- seems slower after clicking around
  (confirmed).  maybe net too?  STILL NEED THIS -- THIS IS HAPPENING!

* leabra: max norm inhib: take max guy, compute amount of inhib that gets his
  activation to given amount above threshold (parameter) -- that's it!  *very* flexible
  as to the distribution of everyone else..

* didn't call LoadInitTarget on LeabraTrainBatchSeedList..-- not repl

------------------
Program issues

* proglib: add dates (fill in!) also fix bug after repeated calls..

--------------------
Other Algorithms:
  * fixup BP, so plugin

--------------

* css include path & files from old css..
* p ((v1 > 0.0) ? (1.0 / v1): 0.0) : gives a div0 error -- should not!
* css #include: make a new codeblock and put all the include stuff in there,
   to get rid of zaplast?  how to best handle?
* css listing is still lame.  maybe just have completely separate global text list, 
  with pointers into that?

------------------
hv model

* move all key db's to programs: makes it more robust
* put code under svn

* document fixes:
* IT fm output: adapt goes up to .12, no adapt is down at .018 -- change it fm output target.
  itfmo05  -- still bust; 
* main thing is high: v2 from v4 seems to be bad..  try run with just norel adapt + output
* output should get more from IT than V4??  check wiki for prior experiments..

* do repeat testing
* show retina stuff in netview (record params in trial log too)

* add 3d model rendering using inventor..
 
* train model to identify location of key target:
  CHL:
  minus phase is where looking now; plus is where next
  if correct recognition on plus, then it serves to train, else not!
  MINUS_MINUS_PLUS or prev MINUS vs this PLUS with repetition of
  same item

  RL:
  spatial system on t-1 decides where to look at t
  if model recognizes object at t, pvlv gets reward
  cs association with good look decisions drives reward at t-1

-----------
css:

* css_console.cpp: complete obj.mbr expressions..

------------------
* datatable views:

  - struct update debug on hv model
  - when editing a datatable_impl, need to send refresh update to display
  - initial panel is not updated..  just stick in render_impl and be done with it??  no..
  - view at is too far zoomed out -- can't seem to fix this at all, any way I try..
  - colorscale changes not sending signal
  - add data_spacing to graph view?

  - all views: add bool for draggers (in gridview; only active for structural re-init)

--------------------
* netview: 

* add 2d text flag for netview. play with complexity vis-a-vis rendering
  (probably not worth it for flag -- costs a lot in render but is not a big
  deal..)

-----------
Check:

-----------
Broader issues:

* configuring network properties: currently various button menus but need more efficient?
* specifically connecting layers!

-----------
current bugs:


---------------
Tom's project:

* replace condlist with datatables -- just do all the ops on the datatables 
  directly; lots of datatableloops!


-------
lower pri:

* cleanup other uses of RunPending -> process events or remove??  test for
  need for css Cont RunPending -- test in hv model.

* add #CAT to everything in leabra_*.h, and fixup comments

* checkconfig on functions -- fun can only appear in functions (but not vice-versa..)

* test FILE string_stream.css: ptr = 0?

* view colors: enum with different built-in styles

* make netview xydrag handles thicker: create new default image by replacing existing
   with thicker bars;

----------
arg directives
