leabra todo list:

* seeds in programs: just add as a builtin class to program (also timing) -- general 
  enough to be needed everywhere..

* taBase::CutLinks_taAuto() -> DelPointer any taBase* members..

* add CheckNetwork (from process code in 3.2)
* check UserScript::ImportFromFile (how to just read in raw?  get something?)

* deal with sequences
* deal with small-batch weight updates
* deal with dmem: network counters aggregate across epoch.. others..

* add #CAT to everything in netstru and leabra.h, and fixup comments

* bugs: network display updates at start of trial with weird state info, despite wrap
  by DataUpdate guys, etc
