leabra todo list:

commit:

* profile  check on editing a datatable and then clicking away, for sub-rasa updates do dialog
  -- seems slower after clicking around (confirmed).  maybe net too?

    -- not showing up in profile.. need to maybe setup profile versions of everything?

* datatable update: change to network style so that display flag is used earlier from dataupdate and not later in basic udpatedisplay

* copying a network: links are not fixed (send_idx, etc)

* saving 12ax model *with* units, then close project: get a crash.  not without. spec.CutLinks

* v3convert: 
  * epoch timer not being set on 12ax convert in epoch mon

* enforce naming rules on layer names, to match data table columns.


check:

* quit has changes thing, close project does not.. (ticket)

* filer needs to use basic context (ticket filed)
  * tmp name is bizzare -- fname filer issues (ticket)

------------------
Program issues

* proglib: add dates!
* dirty!!

* edit user script: non-modal dialog w/ better (narrower) default sizing

--------------------
Other Algorithms:
  * fixup BP, so plugin

--------------

* datatable: row manip functions like rowcopy, moverow, insert row, etc
  * add DataGetCurRowVars -- just like data calc loop var getter -- use in applyimage
  * concat columns
  * datatable time average

* ta_math: convolve; gaussian/uniform gen; time averaging with diff kernels

* css: p voidfun = crash; bindargs seems to not be getting the void??
  e.g., p taMisc::include_paths.List();
  css include path & files from old css..

------------------
hv model

* debug DMEM timing: add start/end timer with some flags on the control guy and use
for setting network stats vars on dmem_timing.

* IT fm output: adapt goes up to .12, no adapt is down at .018 -- change it fm output target.
  itfmo05  -- still bust; 

* main thing is high: v2 from v4 seems to be bad..  try run with just norel adapt + output

* output should get more from IT than V4??  check wiki for prior experiments..

* do repeat testing
* show retina stuff in netview (record params in trial log to)
 
* train model to identify location of key target:
  CHL:
  minus phase is where looking now; plus is where next
  if correct recognition on plus, then it serves to train, else not!
  MINUS_MINUS_PLUS or prev MINUS vs this PLUS with repetition of
  same item

  RL:
  spatial system on t-1 decides where to look at t
  if model recognizes object at t, pvlv gets reward
  cs association with good look decisions drives reward at t-1

---------------
Tom's project:

* replace condlist with datatables -- just do all the ops on the datatables 
  directly; lots of datatableloops!

-----------
css:

* css_console.cpp: complete obj.mbr expressions..

------------------
* datatable views:

  - struct update debug on hv model
  - when editing a datatable_impl, need to send refresh update to display
  - initial panel is not updated..  just stick in render_impl and be done with it??  no..
  - view at is too far zoomed out -- can't seem to fix this at all, any way I try..
  - colorscale changes not sending signal
  - add data_spacing to graph view?

  - all views: add bool for draggers (in gridview; only active for structural re-init)

--------------------
* netview: 

-----------
Check:

-----------
Broader issues:

* configuring network properties: currently various button menus but need more efficient?
* specifically connecting layers!

-----------
current bugs:



-------
lower pri:

* add #CAT to everything in leabra_*.h, and fixup comments

* checkconfig on functions -- fun can only appear in functions (but not vice-versa..)

* test FILE string_stream.css: ptr = 0?

* view colors: enum with different built-in styles

* make netview xydrag handles thicker: create new default image by replacing existing
   with thicker bars;

----------
arg directives
