leabra todo list:

* Netmon should have a network variable that contextualizes everything for given network
-- otherwize you need to set each one individually -- painful.

* ApplyInputsImage: needs to use same vals in plus and minus phases: just check for 
  phase_no == 0 for filtering the data..

* create MathFuns library with all kinds of math-related things in it, incl lots of #CAT
docs..: add all float_RArray funs, for matricies.

* extrew in trial monitor seems not to be working: 12ax demo

* relnet stat

* startup script

--------
check:

* lwriter disp name incl data & net

* add basic file logging stuff to datatable: just a stream and some functions..

* applyexternal should just use current network context setting, instead of arg.

* change applyexternal -> applyinputdata?  YES

---------

current bugs:

* need to be able to update args without changing program call target: check for
  mismatch in arg count!

* display arg value in program call

* need special menu action to save in prog_lib

-------
lower pri:

* add data guys to prog toolbox: need a 2nd panel??  BRAD doing

* add "print" Progel?

* css_console.cpp: complete obj.mbr expressions..

* add MEDIAN, MODE, FIRST, LAST, to vec_ and Aggregate; mv agg to appropriate place

* add SVD/Eigenvec etc to math and then as data ops and dataprog's

* datachanged for obj -> update corresp var; datachanged goes to obj_list --
  need hook in there, but it is a generic list..

* test FILE string_stream.css: ptr = 0?

---
* deal with small-batch weight updates
* deal with dmem: network counters aggregate across epoch.. rndseed aggregate, etc

* add #CAT to everything in netstru and leabra.h, and fixup comments

----------
arg directives

----------
Not sure if still an issue:

* LayerSpec CheckConfig needs to test for existence of units before doing Leaf();?
* need state flag for changing type: don't try to replace spec pointers on cutlinks.
