leabra todo list:

* program dirty not getting set -- init not recompiling

* dataops: random patterns!

* relnet stat

* convert Connection to basic object, Con_Group to an obj that owns an 
  array of such things, and recv. send. to list of such objs.

* create MathFuns library with all kinds of math-related things in it, incl lots of #CAT
docs..: add all float_RArray funs, for matricies.

* change progs to pass data_table in same way network is passed?  maybe not?  why??

* add #CAT to everything in netstru and leabra.h, and fixup comments

-----------
Program issues

css:

* set display_width from console (overload qconsole resize event and update)

-----------
Check:

* extrew in trial monitor seems not to be working: 12ax demo
* 12ax: change gp name to include unique ctr so group fun works.

* datatable - make unique col names; call for join op..


-----------
current bugs:


-------
lower pri:

* checkconfig on functions -- fun can only appear in functions (but not vice-versa..)

* more color highlighting in general of programs?

* css_console.cpp: complete obj.mbr expressions..

* add MEDIAN, MODE, FIRST, LAST, to vec_ and Aggregate; mv agg to appropriate place

* add SVD/Eigenvec etc to math and then as data ops and dataprog's

* test FILE string_stream.css: ptr = 0?

----------
arg directives

----------
Not sure if still an issue:

* LayerSpec CheckConfig needs to test for existence of units before doing Leaf();?
* need state flag for changing type: don't try to replace spec pointers on cutlinks.
