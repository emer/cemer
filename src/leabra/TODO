leabra todo list:

commit:

------------------
* graphview: 

  - panel!
  - CNT axis in panel; test..
  - 0 axis range causing problems somewhere (source of non-visibility on startup?)
  - mat z index not working (axis probably -- need a dummy axis)
  - shared axis: update ranges
  - error bars: build into graph line
  - raster plots

------------------
* gridview: 

  - dataanal defaults: distmatrixgrid: n_rows = 1, TOP_ZERO
  - more room on top line of panel for ctrls.

  - struct update debug on hv model
  - when editing a datatable_impl, need to send refresh update to display
  - initial panel is not updated..  just stick in render_impl and be done with it??
  - view at is too far zoomed out -- can't seem to fix this at all, any way I try..
  - colorscale changes not sending signal

  - all views: add bool for draggers (in gridview; only active for structural re-init)
  - all views: set color spec button in panel (in gridview)

------------------
* netview: move everything to one line in colorscale as in other views; add colors button
  
  - also add monitor buttons to various netview objects/context menus -- can do context menu
  in T3 mode and monitor it!  prompt for variable.

------------------
hv model

* debug DMEM timing: add start/end timer with some flags on the control guy and use
for setting network stats vars on dmem_timing.

* IT fm output: adapt goes up to .12, no adapt is down at .018 -- change it fm output target.
  itfmo05  -- still bust

* main thing is high: v2 from v4 seems to be bad..  try run with just norel adapt + output

* output should get more from IT than V4??  check wiki for prior experiments..


* do repeat testing
* show retina stuff in netview (record params in trial log to)
 
* train model to identify location of key target:
  CHL:
  minus phase is where looking now; plus is where next
  if correct recognition on plus, then it serves to train, else not!
  MINUS_MINUS_PLUS or prev MINUS vs this PLUS with repetition of
  same item

  RL:
  spatial system on t-1 decides where to look at t
  if model recognizes object at t, pvlv gets reward
  cs association with good look decisions drives reward at t-1

--------------------
* view colors: enum with different built-in styles

  * support the Flags for program guys: bg-only mode -- seems to require an index??

--------------------
* netview: 

 * make xydrag handles thicker: create new default image by replacing existing
   with thicker bars;

--------------

* datatable: row manip functions like rowcopy, moverow, insert row, etc
  * add DataGetCurRowVars -- just like data calc loop var getter -- use in applyimage
  * concat columns
  * datatable time average

* ta_math: convolve; gaussian/uniform gen; time averaging with diff kernels

* v3convert: end up with 2 bias.unit links from copy op?

* css: p voidfun = crash; bindargs seems to not be getting the void??
  e.g., p taMisc::include_paths.List();
  css include path & files from old css..

* replace condlist with datatables -- just do all the ops on the datatables 
  directly; lots of datatableloops!

-----------
Program issues

* proglib: add dates!

* edit user script: non-modal dialog w/ better (narrower) default sizing

css:

* css_console.cpp: complete obj.mbr expressions..

-----------
Check:

-----------
Broader issues:

* configuring network properties: currently various button menus but need more efficient?

-----------
current bugs:



-------
lower pri:

* add #CAT to everything in leabra_*.h, and fixup comments

* checkconfig on functions -- fun can only appear in functions (but not vice-versa..)

* test FILE string_stream.css: ptr = 0?

----------
arg directives
