commit:

Cancel Err Dialog; CheckConfig fail != INIT on programs; tags for programs & prog_lib


== Virtual Env

* initial rot maybe 180deg off from one computed by ode??
* add complexity params to various levels
* add a function to update texture when texture is changed -- just like the other guy 
  for image -- (test that too!)

--------------------
Other Algorithms:
  * cs, so, rbp? (rbp requires time stuff -- probably not worth it).  maybe apbp?

------------
current:

* losing net init variable (act)?

* program edit control panel -- causes stale of calling progs! (not that one) - #490

* leabra test all progp

* have init values of wt_scale parameters prior to adapting?? yes

* check: test datatable /matrix cut/paste ops

== Netview:

* Can't view weights with 2 nets in same view! (callback register is global?? -- incl obj?)
* Iconify layer -- disp value
* self prjn should be better..

* LOWPRI: .5 rounding fixed mostly: Layer move digitize by units -- not clear how to do..  maybe in xform coupling eq?

== Program

* ProgVar FLAG: CTRL_RO -- read only in control panel #374
* progexpr not finding variables in function args
* proglib: add dates (fill in!)

== PVLV:

* output gate guys only get pv da, not lv??

* add group_name to CondEnv code -- Epochgp PERMUTED, etc..

* create simulated SIR test case.. 2 repeated guys with reward assoc.

== Misc

== Graph

* log units on axis

---

* #ARG_VAL_FM_n_xxx -- get init value of arg from given member (can be a path)
  * ProgEl* fm name!

* datatable: 
  * Join should be symmetric

* leabra inhib: compute distance from "ideal" inhib based on k target netin (e.g., .4)
  and add extra inhib in proportion.  set point in for inhib value itself.  makes the
  weakly activated units more weak, and the strongly activated more weak too!  pop out??

check:

------------------
Program issues

--------------

* css include path & files from old css..
* p ((v1 > 0.0) ? (1.0 / v1): 0.0) : gives a div0 error -- should not!
* css #include: make a new codeblock and put all the include stuff in there,
   to get rid of zaplast?  how to best handle?
* css listing is still lame.  maybe just have completely separate global text list, 
  with pointers into that?

------------------
hv model

* multitest
* move all key db's to programs: makes it more robust
* put code under svn

* document fixes:
* IT fm output: adapt goes up to .12, no adapt is down at .018 -- change it fm output target.
  itfmo05  -- still bust; 
* main thing is high: v2 from v4 seems to be bad..  try run with just norel adapt + output
* output should get more from IT than V4??  check wiki for prior experiments..

* add 3d model rendering using inventor..
 
* train model to identify location of key target:
  CHL:
  minus phase is where looking now; plus is where next
  if correct recognition on plus, then it serves to train, else not!
  MINUS_MINUS_PLUS or prev MINUS vs this PLUS with repetition of
  same item

  RL:
  spatial system on t-1 decides where to look at t
  if model recognizes object at t, pvlv gets reward
  cs association with good look decisions drives reward at t-1

-----------
css:

* css_console.cpp: complete obj.mbr expressions..

------------------
* datatable views:

  - when editing a datatable_impl, need to send refresh update to display
  - initial panel is not updated..  just stick in render_impl and be done with it??  no..
  - colorscale changes not sending signal
  - add data_spacing to graph view?

-----------
Broader issues:

-----------
current bugs:

-------
lower pri:

* cleanup other uses of RunPending -> process events or remove??  test for
  need for css Cont RunPending -- test in hv model.

* add #CAT to everything in leabra_*.h, and fixup comments

* test FILE string_stream.css: ptr = 0?

* view colors: enum with different built-in styles

----------
arg directives
