leabra todo list:

* test FILE string_stream.css: ptr = 0?

* need GUI_READ_ONLY vs READ_ONLY -- interface vs. css -- some stuff should
  really be read only in css like owner..

-------


* LayerSpec CheckConfig needs to test for existence of units before doing Leaf();

* need state flag for changing type: don't try to replace spec pointers on cutlinks.

* wizards: reactivate env making stuff -- makes life easier -- and simple procs??

* something funky about converted networks.. save & rebuild works but initial one does not..
  * still true!

---

* datatable aggregation

* create MathFuns library with all kinds of math-related things in it, incl lots of #CAT
docs..

* deal with small-batch weight updates
* deal with dmem: network counters aggregate across epoch.. rndseed aggregate, etc

* add #CAT to everything in netstru and leabra.h, and fixup comments

* bugs: network display updates at start of trial with weird state info, despite wrap
  by DataUpdate guys, etc
* profile: slow!!!

* change scope to #PROGRAM for vars in callmethod -- needs a special override to locate
the global_vars..
