leabra todo list:

commit:

* Name empty frame for first object in it
* function select edit: addition name should be additional, not replace
* DataProg -- set names of sub-specs
* one function to add Program controls to select edit (with prefix name)
* wizard stdprogs calls autoconfig on layerwriter
* projection from is a smartref, not a raw pointer!  also, fixed updating when name
changes in setfrom
* prjn names are read only
* fix that crazy "Add Frame" thing after selecting in t3view -- overloaded right mouse
button event thing: basic default one and the one in the examiner viewer.  just 
got rid of the default one and use the one in the examiner viewer -- you just can't
have two competing ones, and viewer guy us MUCH more useful.
* get current epoch in LeabraTrain (add IfGui thing to other algos with this too)
* token and typedef selector optimizations: if only one item available on new selector,
  select it and make it read only.  if none available, then so indicate, also read only
* fixed netview spec selection bug: ItemSelected signal no longer operative from iTree --
  need to use Notify guy

* wizard not showing on new project -- despite auto_show and being 2nd item
* selectedit browser name not updating when changed (in general, various name changes don't seem to update the browser)

== Virtual Env

* add complexity params to various levels
* add a function to update texture when texture is changed -- just like the other guy 
  for image -- (test that too!)

--------------------
Other Algorithms:
  * rbp -- at least support all process functions in network

------------
current:

* select view tab with url in doc

* Duplicate project (455)

* convert old file: cancel doesn't work!

* leabra test all progp

* check: test datatable /matrix cut/paste ops

== Netview:

* Can't view weights with 2 nets in same view! (callback register is global?? -- incl obj?)
* Iconify layer -- disp value
* self prjn should be better..

== Program

* ProgVar FLAG: CTRL_RO -- read only in control panel #374
* progexpr: not finding variables in function args, leading - sign is problematic
* proglib: add dates (fill in!)

== PVLV:

* output gate guys only get pv da, not lv??

* add group_name to CondEnv code -- Epochgp PERMUTED, etc..

* create simulated SIR test case.. 2 repeated guys with reward assoc.

== Misc

== Graph

* logarithmic units on axis

---

* #ARG_VAL_FM_n_xxx -- get init value of arg from given member (can be a path)
  * ProgEl* fm name!

* leabra inhib: compute distance from "ideal" inhib based on k target netin (e.g., .4)
  and add extra inhib in proportion.  set point in for inhib value itself.  makes the
  weakly activated units more weak, and the strongly activated more weak too!  pop out??

check:

------------------
Program issues

--------------

* css include path & files from old css..
* p ((v1 > 0.0) ? (1.0 / v1): 0.0) : gives a div0 error -- should not!
* css #include: make a new codeblock and put all the include stuff in there,
   to get rid of zaplast?  how to best handle?
* css listing is still lame.  maybe just have completely separate global text list, 
  with pointers into that?

------------------
hv model

* move all key db's to programs: makes it more robust

* document fixes:
* IT fm output: adapt goes up to .12, no adapt is down at .018 -- change it fm output target.
  itfmo05  -- still bust; 
* main thing is high: v2 from v4 seems to be bad..  try run with just norel adapt + output
* output should get more from IT than V4??  check wiki for prior experiments..

* add 3d model rendering using inventor..
 
* train model to identify location of key target:
  CHL:
  minus phase is where looking now; plus is where next
  if correct recognition on plus, then it serves to train, else not!
  MINUS_MINUS_PLUS or prev MINUS vs this PLUS with repetition of
  same item

  RL:
  spatial system on t-1 decides where to look at t
  if model recognizes object at t, pvlv gets reward
  cs association with good look decisions drives reward at t-1

-----------
css:

* css_console.cpp: complete obj.mbr expressions..

------------------
* datatable views:

  - when editing a datatable_impl, need to send refresh update to display
  - initial panel is not updated..  just stick in render_impl and be done with it??  no..
  - colorscale changes not sending signal
  - add data_spacing to graph view?

-----------
Broader issues:

-----------
current bugs:

-------
lower pri:

* cleanup other uses of RunPending -> process events or remove??  test for
  need for css Cont RunPending -- test in hv model.

* add #CAT to everything in leabra_*.h, and fixup comments

* test FILE string_stream.css: ptr = 0?

* view colors: enum with different built-in styles

----------
arg directives
