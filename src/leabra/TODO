leabra todo list:

commit:


------------
current:

* gauss smooth on simplelines, then graph it -- get crash
* token chooser not showing NULL label -- probably ok..

* copy progel -- update pointers relative to program.  key -- otherwise ptrs
  are to old vars etc.  don't even notice.

* all names = c_type

* datatable: 
  * add DataGetCurRowVars -- just like data calc loop var getter -- use in applyimage
  * concat columns

* edit user script: non-modal dialog w/ better (narrower) default sizing
  (add c++ syntax hightight?)

* leabra inhib: compute distance from "ideal" inhib based on k target netin (e.g., .4)
  and add extra inhib in proportion.  set point in for inhib value itself.  makes the
  weakly activated units more weak, and the strongly activated more weak too!  pop out??

* project display needs update after loading: filename is not there..

check:

* datatable load not getting file name ext AGAIN!

* filer needs to use basic context (ticket filed)
  * convert tmp name is bizzare -- fname filer issues (ticket)

* leabra: max norm inhib: take max guy, compute amount of inhib that gets his
  activation to given amount above threshold (parameter) -- that's it!  *very* flexible
  as to the distribution of everyone else..

* #288: profile check on editing a datatable and then clicking away, for
  sub-rasa updates do dialog -- seems slower after clicking around
  (confirmed).  maybe net too?  STILL NEED THIS -- THIS IS HAPPENING!

------------------
Program issues

* proglib: add dates (fill in!) also fix bug after repeated calls..

--------------------
Other Algorithms:
  * fixup BP, so plugin

--------------

* css include path & files from old css..

------------------
hv model

* move all key db's to programs: makes it more robust
* put code under svn

* document fixes:
* IT fm output: adapt goes up to .12, no adapt is down at .018 -- change it fm output target.
  itfmo05  -- still bust; 
* main thing is high: v2 from v4 seems to be bad..  try run with just norel adapt + output
* output should get more from IT than V4??  check wiki for prior experiments..


* do repeat testing
* show retina stuff in netview (record params in trial log to)
 
* train model to identify location of key target:
  CHL:
  minus phase is where looking now; plus is where next
  if correct recognition on plus, then it serves to train, else not!
  MINUS_MINUS_PLUS or prev MINUS vs this PLUS with repetition of
  same item

  RL:
  spatial system on t-1 decides where to look at t
  if model recognizes object at t, pvlv gets reward
  cs association with good look decisions drives reward at t-1

-----------
css:

* css_console.cpp: complete obj.mbr expressions..

------------------
* datatable views:

  - struct update debug on hv model
  - when editing a datatable_impl, need to send refresh update to display
  - initial panel is not updated..  just stick in render_impl and be done with it??  no..
  - view at is too far zoomed out -- can't seem to fix this at all, any way I try..
  - colorscale changes not sending signal
  - add data_spacing to graph view?

  - all views: add bool for draggers (in gridview; only active for structural re-init)

--------------------
* netview: 

* add 2d text flag for netview. play with complexity vis-a-vis rendering
  (probably not worth it for flag -- costs a lot in render but is not a big
  deal..)

-----------
Check:

-----------
Broader issues:

* configuring network properties: currently various button menus but need more efficient?
* specifically connecting layers!

-----------
current bugs:


---------------
Tom's project:

* replace condlist with datatables -- just do all the ops on the datatables 
  directly; lots of datatableloops!


-------
lower pri:

* cleanup other uses of RunPending -> process events or remove??  test for
  need for css Cont RunPending -- test in hv model.

* add #CAT to everything in leabra_*.h, and fixup comments

* checkconfig on functions -- fun can only appear in functions (but not vice-versa..)

* test FILE string_stream.css: ptr = 0?

* view colors: enum with different built-in styles

* make netview xydrag handles thicker: create new default image by replacing existing
   with thicker bars;
