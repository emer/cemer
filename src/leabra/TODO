leabra todo list:

* taImageProc class w/ highvis stuff:
  - make basic directory filename datatable thing (in taDataProc; with filter..)
    - GetMakeCol on fname -- allows other fields
  - do program stuff to make it work: training dtable is list of files (per above)
     (do simple extension to read dave's files into datatable)
     applyinputs reads filename and calls fun..
  - import network and run it!!
* V1RFPrjnSpec in leabra_extra needs to be updated to new DOG filer spec..

* create MathFuns library with all kinds of math-related things in it, incl lots of #CAT
docs..: add all float_RArray funs, for matricies.

* add data guys to prog toolbox: need a 2nd panel??

* extrew in trial monitor seems not to be working: 12ax demo

* add "print" Progel?

* encase programs in struct update brackets to prevent updating

* css_console.cpp: complete obj.mbr expressions..

---------

current bugs:

* need to be able to update args without changing program call target: check for
  mismatch in arg count!

* Netmon should have a network variable that contextualizes everything for given network
-- otherwize you need to set each one individually -- painful.

* checkconfig -- crashes from check all vs. first fail: safety violation

* applyexternal should just use current network context setting, instead of arg.

* change applyexternal -> applyinputdata?  YES

* display arg value in program call

* actions menu comes before object in program, other places?

* need special menu action to save in prog_lib

-------
lower pri:

* add MEDIAN, MODE, FIRST, LAST, to vec_ and Aggregate; mv agg to appropriate place

* add SVD/Eigenvec etc to math and then as data ops and dataprog's

* use FindMakeColName for all dt copy/constr stuff (w/orphaning)

* profile: slow!!! -- probably all the uae's triggering cascade of datachanged stuff..
  (faster now!)

* datachanged for obj -> update corresp var; datachanged goes to obj_list --
  need hook in there, but it is a generic list..

* test FILE string_stream.css: ptr = 0?

---

* datatable aggregation:

  -------
  taDataOps static class:

  helper classes

  * DataSortEls = column ref/name, op; DataSortSpec object = list
  * DataSelectEls = column ref/name, expr; DataSortSpec object = list

  void Select(DataTable* dest, DataTable* src, 
  void Sort(DataTable* dest, DataTable* src, DataSortSpec& sort_spec);



  -------
  ProgEl's:

  DataProg -- just has DataTableRef, and some common convenience funs..

  need to be able to choose columns from datatable from menu (dt->data els)

  DataFilter: (select)
    implied loop over all rows of data table
    for each: local vars created with names = colum names (UAE in dt needs to 
      enforce good css-names)
    filter expr string: e.g., Name == "horiz" && sse > .5

  DataSort:
    * column, op list of sort fields (alpha, etc), in order: a DataSortSpec object -- list
      of DataSortEls; need database

   
    
  
   




* deal with small-batch weight updates
* deal with dmem: network counters aggregate across epoch.. rndseed aggregate, etc

* add #CAT to everything in netstru and leabra.h, and fixup comments

* bugs: network display updates at start of trial with weird state info, despite wrap
  by DataUpdate guys, etc

----------
arg directives

----------
Not sure if still an issue:

* LayerSpec CheckConfig needs to test for existence of units before doing Leaf();?
* need state flag for changing type: don't try to replace spec pointers on cutlinks.
