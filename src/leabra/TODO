leabra todo list:

* default fonts: smaller on mac; entry in prefs

* progvar object_val should be a ref, not a pointer: not refcount

* seeds in programs: user just adds as needed; no assumptions; auto obj->var..

* create MathFuns library with all kinds of math-related things in it, incl lots of #CAT
docs..

* taBase::CutLinks_taAuto() -> DelPointer any taBase* members..

* check UserScript::ImportFromFile (how to just read in raw?  get something?)

* deal with sequences
* deal with small-batch weight updates
* deal with dmem: network counters aggregate across epoch.. others..

* add #CAT to everything in netstru and leabra.h, and fixup comments

* bugs: network display updates at start of trial with weird state info, despite wrap
  by DataUpdate guys, etc
* profile: slow!!!
