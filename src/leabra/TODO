leabra todo list:

* v3convert: end up with 2 bias.unit links from copy op?

* ta_dataanal.h: cluster not working
  
* datagen: random patterns!

* dataproc duplicate rows

* css: p voidfun = crash; bindargs seems to not be getting the void??
  e.g., p taMisc::include_paths.List();

* do color network!

* replace condlist with datatables -- just do all the ops on the datatables 
  directly; lots of datatableloops!

-----------
Program issues

css:

* css_console.cpp: complete obj.mbr expressions..

-----------
Check:

-----------
Broader issues:

* configuring network properties: currently various button menus but need more efficient?

-----------
current bugs:



-------
lower pri:

* add #CAT to everything in leabra_*.h, and fixup comments

* checkconfig on functions -- fun can only appear in functions (but not vice-versa..)

* test FILE string_stream.css: ptr = 0?

----------
arg directives

----------
Not sure if still an issue:

* LayerSpec CheckConfig needs to test for existence of units before doing Leaf();?
* need state flag for changing type: don't try to replace spec pointers on cutlinks.
