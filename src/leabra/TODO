leabra todo list:

* test FILE string_stream.css: ptr = 0?

* create MathFuns library with all kinds of math-related things in it, incl lots of #CAT
docs..: add all float_RArray funs, for matricies.

* extrew in trial monitor seems not to be working: 12ax demo

-------

* profile: slow!!! -- probably all the uae's triggering cascade of datachanged stuff..
  (faster now!)

* datachanged for obj -> update corresp var; datachanged goes to obj_list --
  need hook in there, but it is a generic list..

---

* datatable aggregation

* deal with small-batch weight updates
* deal with dmem: network counters aggregate across epoch.. rndseed aggregate, etc

* add #CAT to everything in netstru and leabra.h, and fixup comments

* bugs: network display updates at start of trial with weird state info, despite wrap
  by DataUpdate guys, etc

* change scope to #PROGRAM for vars in callmethod -- needs a special override to locate
the global_vars..


----------
Not sure if still an issue:

* LayerSpec CheckConfig needs to test for existence of units before doing Leaf();?
* need state flag for changing type: don't try to replace spec pointers on cutlinks.
