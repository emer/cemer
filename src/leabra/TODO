leabra todo list:

* create MathFuns library with all kinds of math-related things in it, incl lots of #CAT
docs..: add all float_RArray funs, for matricies.

* call trialmon init in default epoch prog: only has one epoch full of trials

* extrew in trial monitor seems not to be working: 12ax demo

* relnet stat

* startup script

* add param on datatable for dmem diff log file names or not

-----------
Program issues

* prompt is now messed up: pdp++ > >xxx and just > for program cmd shell
* syntax error ^ doesn't show up in right place..
* Output::R should work even though R is a defined constant variable: need
   a more inclusive type for things after the :: scoper

* for program args: if var of same name exists in caller, set as default init arg..
* register VT_xx in global css namespace..
* sometimes method s_args don't copy, sometimes they do..
* add "assign" Progel (result,  expr)
* add "print" Progel?
* add "comment" progel -- just displays a comment in display, perhaps with diff color?
* more color highlighting in general of programs?
* warn about = in if condition (instead of ==) -- maybe even in css?

-----------

* LeabraBatch

* SaveNetwork[Weights] program -- uses above

---------

current bugs:

* not reading last col & row of test.dat!

* can't run startup.css in -nogui or -gui!

--------
check:

* add avg_cycles to network, monitor


-------
lower pri:

* css_console.cpp: complete obj.mbr expressions..

* add MEDIAN, MODE, FIRST, LAST, to vec_ and Aggregate; mv agg to appropriate place

* add SVD/Eigenvec etc to math and then as data ops and dataprog's

* datachanged for obj -> update corresp var; datachanged goes to obj_list --
  need hook in there, but it is a generic list..

* test FILE string_stream.css: ptr = 0?

---
* deal with small-batch weight updates
* deal with dmem: network counters aggregate across epoch.. rndseed aggregate, etc

* add #CAT to everything in netstru and leabra.h, and fixup comments

----------
arg directives

----------
Not sure if still an issue:

* LayerSpec CheckConfig needs to test for existence of units before doing Leaf();?
* need state flag for changing type: don't try to replace spec pointers on cutlinks.
