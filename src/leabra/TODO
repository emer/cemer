leabra todo list:

* 12ax failing on connect: probably a bug with different con_type during load -- trial syn dep
  overwriting the memory of the projection (getting null RecvCons)

  * network copy probably not working..  send should not copy. recv not getting units..
    figure out better system for this
  * scan_congroups in netdata netmonitor; check

* consolidate the netstru checkconfig stuff once and for all -- not using proper
  checkerror messages, is confusing, etc

* Explicit Save net needs to override not-saving-weights setting from project!!
  * rename save_rmv_units -> net_save_no_units;

* program dirty not getting set -- init not recompiling

* dataops: random patterns!

* relnet stat



* create MathFuns library with all kinds of math-related things in it, incl lots of #CAT
docs..: add all float_RArray funs, for matricies.

* change progs to pass data_table in same way network is passed?  maybe not?  why??

* add #CAT to everything in leabra.h, and fixup comments

-----------
Program issues

css:

* console cursor only at end
* set display_width from console (overload qconsole resize event and update)
* css_console.cpp: complete obj.mbr expressions..

-----------
Check:

* extrew in trial monitor seems not to be working: 12ax demo
* 12ax: change gp name to include unique ctr so group fun works.

* datatable - make unique col names; call for join op..


-----------
current bugs:


-------
lower pri:

* checkconfig on functions -- fun can only appear in functions (but not vice-versa..)

* more color highlighting in general of programs?

* add MEDIAN, MODE, FIRST, LAST, to vec_ and Aggregate; mv agg to appropriate place

* add SVD/Eigenvec etc to math and then as data ops and dataprog's

* test FILE string_stream.css: ptr = 0?

----------
arg directives

----------
Not sure if still an issue:

* LayerSpec CheckConfig needs to test for existence of units before doing Leaf();?
* need state flag for changing type: don't try to replace spec pointers on cutlinks.
