leabra todo list:

commit:

New functionality for displaying layer values:
* on LayerView, disp_mode for OUTPUT_NAME -- output_name string (displays output_name
instead of unit values)
* also, frame only layer disp mode + function to align an existing view to the layer
-- can replace layer with a gridview or whatever!
* also created T3DataViewMain -- subclass of par with its own permanent transform
that serves as base class for main views such as NetView, etc.
* implemented #VIEWMENU directive

------------
current:

* need hard enum val chooser in std progvar edit!  not sure how best to do that
 -- probably need a separate int that is used and then copied.

== Netview:

* Can't view weights with 2 nets in same view! (callback register is global?? -- incl obj?)
* Iconify layer -- disp value
* self prjn should be better..

* LOWPRI: .5 rounding fixed mostly: Layer move digitize by units -- not clear how to do..  maybe in xform coupling eq?

== Program

* test new guys
* progexpr not finding variables in function args
* brad's bug on drag of objs
* proglib: add dates (fill in!)
* checkconfig on functions -- fun can only appear in functions (but not vice-versa..)
* ProgVar FLAG: CTRL_RO -- read only in control panel #374

== PVLV:

* output gate guys only get pv da, not lv??

* add group_name to CondEnv code -- Epochgp PERMUTED, etc..

* create simulated SIR test case.. 2 repeated guys with reward assoc.

== Inventor

* import object files
* render objects to bitmap and use to present to network

== Misc

* CHECK: add DataUpdate brackets in Filter op -- still doesn't fix problem!

== Graph

* log units on axis

---

* #ARG_VAL_FM_n_xxx -- get init value of arg from given member (can be a path)
  * ProgEl* fm name!

* datatable: 
  * Join should be symmetric

* leabra inhib: compute distance from "ideal" inhib based on k target netin (e.g., .4)
  and add extra inhib in proportion.  set point in for inhib value itself.  makes the
  weakly activated units more weak, and the strongly activated more weak too!  pop out??

Program issues

--------------------
Other Algorithms:
  * fixup BP, so plugin

--------------

* css include path & files from old css..
* p ((v1 > 0.0) ? (1.0 / v1): 0.0) : gives a div0 error -- should not!
* css #include: make a new codeblock and put all the include stuff in there,
   to get rid of zaplast?  how to best handle?
* css listing is still lame.  maybe just have completely separate global text list, 
  with pointers into that?

------------------
hv model

* multitest
* move all key db's to programs: makes it more robust
* put code under svn

* document fixes:
* IT fm output: adapt goes up to .12, no adapt is down at .018 -- change it fm output target.
  itfmo05  -- still bust; 
* main thing is high: v2 from v4 seems to be bad..  try run with just norel adapt + output
* output should get more from IT than V4??  check wiki for prior experiments..

* add 3d model rendering using inventor..
 
* train model to identify location of key target:
  CHL:
  minus phase is where looking now; plus is where next
  if correct recognition on plus, then it serves to train, else not!
  MINUS_MINUS_PLUS or prev MINUS vs this PLUS with repetition of
  same item

  RL:
  spatial system on t-1 decides where to look at t
  if model recognizes object at t, pvlv gets reward
  cs association with good look decisions drives reward at t-1

-----------
css:

* css_console.cpp: complete obj.mbr expressions..

------------------
* datatable views:

  - when editing a datatable_impl, need to send refresh update to display
  - initial panel is not updated..  just stick in render_impl and be done with it??  no..
  - colorscale changes not sending signal
  - add data_spacing to graph view?

-----------
Broader issues:

-----------
current bugs:

-------
lower pri:

* cleanup other uses of RunPending -> process events or remove??  test for
  need for css Cont RunPending -- test in hv model.

* add #CAT to everything in leabra_*.h, and fixup comments

* test FILE string_stream.css: ptr = 0?

* view colors: enum with different built-in styles

----------
arg directives
