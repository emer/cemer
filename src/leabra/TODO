leabra todo list:

commit:

* VIRT_BASE types do not show up in type selector!  also added err msg for creating one
* fixed lazyChildren (i.e., lazy programmer!) so it only shows "+" things where they are 
  actually required -- required looking at the size of the list etc and several other 
  tweaks, and the new autoexpand/select code is actualy critical for making it all work
  right, by driving the final update signal to redraw the new guy in the browser!
* convert old file: cancel doesn't work -- fixed that logic so it should work.

* for proglib default arg, have a tabase arg default chooser function that gets 
method name and arg name and returns a variant def arg val -- activated by #CD
very good general soln!!

* selectedit browser name not updating when changed (in general, various name changes don't seem to update the browser)

* use css parser to process progexpr: have progspace, parse a string, have a special callback
function for whenever a variable is processed..

------------
current:

* find use browse so progs in progedit? Prog editor show
* list editor selects item for browse: editpanel(false)

* program stuff for dealing with startup args?
* impl NO_STEP flag in ctrl panel
* impl READ_ONLY flag in prog vars
* update bug list..
* back button?
* #22 -- update of netview ctrl panel -- happens even in simpler projects

* check: test datatable /matrix cut/paste ops

== Virtual Env

* add complexity params to various levels
* add a function to update texture when texture is changed -- just like the other guy 
  for image -- (test that too!)
* render in nogui mode -- need a special nogui parent to hold the scenegraph, and init of
  types for so (maybe happens anyway)?

== Other Algorithms:
  * rbp -- at least support all process functions in network

== Netview:

* Can't view weights with 2 nets in same view! (callback register is global?? -- incl obj?)
* Iconify layer -- disp value
* self prjn should be better..

== Program

* ProgVar FLAG: CTRL_RO -- read only in control panel #374
* progexpr: not finding variables in function args, leading - sign is problematic
* proglib: add dates (fill in!)

== PVLV:

* output gate guys only get pv da, not lv??

* add group_name to CondEnv code -- Epochgp PERMUTED, etc..

* create simulated SIR test case.. 2 repeated guys with reward assoc.

== Misc

== Graph

* logarithmic units on axis

---

* leabra inhib: compute distance from "ideal" inhib based on k target netin (e.g., .4)
  and add extra inhib in proportion.  set point in for inhib value itself.  makes the
  weakly activated units more weak, and the strongly activated more weak too!  pop out??

Program issues

--------------

* css include path & files from old css..
* p ((v1 > 0.0) ? (1.0 / v1): 0.0) : gives a div0 error -- should not!
* css #include: make a new codeblock and put all the include stuff in there,
   to get rid of zaplast?  how to best handle?
* css listing is still lame.  maybe just have completely separate global text list, 
  with pointers into that?

------------------
hv model

* move all key db's to programs: makes it more robust

* document fixes:
* IT fm output: adapt goes up to .12, no adapt is down at .018 -- change it fm output target.
  itfmo05  -- still bust; 
* main thing is high: v2 from v4 seems to be bad..  try run with just norel adapt + output
* output should get more from IT than V4??  check wiki for prior experiments..

* add 3d model rendering using inventor..
 
* train model to identify location of key target:
  CHL:
  minus phase is where looking now; plus is where next
  if correct recognition on plus, then it serves to train, else not!
  MINUS_MINUS_PLUS or prev MINUS vs this PLUS with repetition of
  same item

  RL:
  spatial system on t-1 decides where to look at t
  if model recognizes object at t, pvlv gets reward
  cs association with good look decisions drives reward at t-1

-----------
css:

* css_console.cpp: complete obj.mbr expressions..

------------------
* datatable views:

  - when editing a datatable_impl, need to send refresh update to display
  - initial panel is not updated..  just stick in render_impl and be done with it??  no..
  - colorscale changes not sending signal
  - add data_spacing to graph view?

-----------
Broader issues:

-----------
current bugs:

-------
lower pri:

* cleanup other uses of RunPending -> process events or remove??  test for
  need for css Cont RunPending -- test in hv model.

* add #CAT to everything in leabra_*.h, and fixup comments

* test FILE string_stream.css: ptr = 0?

* view colors: enum with different built-in styles

----------
arg directives
