TODO list for CSS:

Immediate:

- Breakpoints at pc = 0 don't work: why??

- 2 prompts at start: why?

- fpe test

- rationalize the debugging functions, make like gdb

- suppress redundant { } block within a IF_TRUE or IF_FALSE block: just replace code in upper
  with code in lower.  CleanDoubleBlock is written: need to figure out when to call it!
  seems like we need a post-processing optimization step..

- run optimizer!: clearly addframe and addprog are big.

- top propagation etc should be unnec.  everything should be in space!
  - flag to warn, but keep functionality just in case.

- integrate with programs

-----------------------
Longer-term:

- has a problem with: var-num types of exprs -- gobbles the - into the
num, sees var num (need to fix parser somehow)

- have one command ("info") that gives info on lots of
different things instead of the current lots of commands.
	info "literals"  info "functions"  info "globals", etc.

- document issues about progspaces and class objects refering
to extern objects, etc.

- script errors in auto-run code cause mutiple-loads of a project!

- extern class objects -- when to call constructor?

- fix gui for: inline's

- tab-completion for cssClass things like members, methods, etc.

- compile scoped refs -- enums, etc, with GetScopedNo, etc.

- use new const things to do multi-dim arrays as const objects?

- use ConstExprTop for static variable initializers -- tricky part is
	using it for '=' case, but not for simple decl.

- build in parse code for reading array initializers instead of using
	the existing method, which does not parse variables at all,
	and has trouble with comments, etc.

- multi_space has some bugs on exit (dtor).

- register the endl, flush, bin, hex, etc widgets from the stream library
	in css.  what type are they?  what do they do?
- also register the taLeafItr too.

- initializers for css arrays do not convert variable names into corresponding
	 values, its a pain in the ass..

- bug when you press C-c after having done a cont several times..

- static member elements (functions and members) 
	add static_methods and static_members to class type object
	put in the appropriate searching, etc. functionality

- warnings on enum assignment to non-enum values..

- copy constructors for css classes?

- #define for arbitrary macros (currently only defined or not defined)
	- need to read everything until newline as text, pass it
	to the define constr.  this parses it.
	when its called, it needs to register macro invocation, 
	which reads until ')' as text, performs substitution, 
	replaces text buffer with substituted text, which is then
	parsed..

- do loop does not allow break, continue (write from scratch a do loop
	instead of using the while)

- initializer values for classes: just "read" in data
	and not assumed order like C inits

- a "rigorous" mode that turns off the flexibility and laxitude
	esp. with respect to the C_ptr types
