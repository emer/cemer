leabra todo list:

commit:

* fix wiki parser

* auto scale always symmetric auto scale!

------------
current:

* find use browse so progs in progedit? Prog editor show

* selectedit browser name not updating when changed (in general, various name changes don't seem to update the browser)

* use css parser to process progexpr: have progspace, parse a string, have a special callback
function for whenever a variable is processed..

== Virtual Env

* add complexity params to various levels
* add a function to update texture when texture is changed -- just like the other guy 
  for image -- (test that too!)
* render in nogui mode -- need a special nogui parent to hold the scenegraph, and init of
  types for so (maybe happens anyway)?

== Other Algorithms:
  * rbp -- at least support all process functions in network

== Netview:

* Can't view weights with 2 nets in same view! (callback register is global?? -- incl obj?)
* Iconify layer -- disp value
* self prjn should be better..

== Program

* progexpr: not finding variables in function args, leading - sign is problematic

== PVLV:

* add group_name to CondEnv code -- Epochgp PERMUTED, etc..

* create simulated SIR test case.. 2 repeated guys with reward assoc.

== Misc

== Graph

* logarithmic units on axis

Program issues

--------------

* p ((v1 > 0.0) ? (1.0 / v1): 0.0) : gives a div0 error -- should not!
* css #include: make a new codeblock and put all the include stuff in there,
   to get rid of zaplast?  how to best handle?
* css listing is still lame.  maybe just have completely separate global text list, 
  with pointers into that?

------------------
hv model

* add 3d model rendering using inventor..
 
* train model to identify location of key target:
  CHL:
  minus phase is where looking now; plus is where next
  if correct recognition on plus, then it serves to train, else not!
  MINUS_MINUS_PLUS or prev MINUS vs this PLUS with repetition of
  same item

  RL:
  spatial system on t-1 decides where to look at t
  if model recognizes object at t, pvlv gets reward
  cs association with good look decisions drives reward at t-1

-----------
css:

* css_console.cpp: complete obj.mbr expressions..

------------------
* datatable views:
  - add data_spacing to graph view?

Broader issues:

current bugs:

lower pri:

* add #CAT to everything in leabra_*.h, and fixup comments

* test FILE string_stream.css: ptr = 0?
