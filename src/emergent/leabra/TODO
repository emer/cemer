commit:

------------
current:

* find use browse so progs in progedit? Prog editor show

* selectedit browser name not updating when changed (in general, various name changes don't seem to update the browser)

* use css parser to process progexpr: have progspace, parse a string, have a special callback
function for whenever a variable is processed..

== Virtual Env

* add complexity params to various levels
* add a function to update texture when texture is changed -- just like the other guy 
  for image -- (test that too!)
* render in nogui mode -- need a special nogui parent to hold the scenegraph, and init of
  types for so (maybe happens anyway)?

== Other Algorithms:
  * rbp -- at least support all process functions in network

== Netview:

* Can't view weights with 2 nets in same view! (callback register is global?? -- incl obj?)
* Iconify layer -- disp value
* self prjn should be better..

== Program

* progexpr: not finding variables in function args, leading - sign is problematic -- css parser will fix

== PVLV:

* add group_name to CondEnv code -- Epochgp PERMUTED, etc..

* create simulated SIR test case.. 2 repeated guys with reward assoc.

== Misc

== Graph

* 3d bars & filled bars
* logarithmic units on axis
