// recall- CA3 -> CA1 = 1, ECin -> CA1 = 0

// plus phase: ECin -> ECout auto clamped
// CA3 -> CA1 = 0, ECin -> CA1 = 1
// (same as auto- -- training signal for CA3 -> CA1 is what EC would produce!

// act_q1 = auto encoder minus phase state (in both CA1 and ECout
//   used by HippoEncoderConSpec relative to act_p plus phase)
// act_q3 / act_m = recall minus phase (normal minus phase dynamics for CA3 recall learning)

// learning just happens at end of trial as usual, but encoder projections use
// the act_q2, act_p variables to learn on the right signals

// integrating over two adjacent alpha trials..
