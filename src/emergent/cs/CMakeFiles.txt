########### emergent cs files ###############

# IMPORTANT: this is just a list of files -- the compile commands are all located
# in the emergent/lib dir, which is where everything is actually built
# other targets are in CMakeLists.txt in this directory

# although some attempt is made to keep track of gui-related files, a huge amount
# of additional work would be required to fully split this out, and we need Qt
# anyway, so there really isn't any point to it anymore

# all headers that need maketa run on them
