########### emergent bp files ###############

# IMPORTANT: this is just a list of files -- the compile commands are all located
# in the emergent/lib dir, which is where everything is actually built
# other targets are in CMakeLists.txt in this directory

# although some attempt is made to keep track of gui-related files, a huge amount
# of additional work would be required to fully split this out, and we need Qt
# anyway, so there really isn't any point to it anymore

# all headers that need maketa run on them
set(bp_HEADS_MAKETA
    bp.h
    rbp.h
#    bp_v3_compat.h
)

# all heads -- include maketa generated ones here
set(bp_HEADS
    bp.h
    rbp.h
#    bp_v3_compat.h
)

# all source files to compile: NOTE: do NOT include TA or .moc files -- auto generated
set(bp_SRCS
    bp.cpp
    rbp.cpp
#    bp_v3_compat.cpp
)
