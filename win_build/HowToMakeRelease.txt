How To Make an Emergent Release

notes: 
  * when you change from Debug to Release or vv you must touch config.h to force remaketa
    just open config.h, add space/backspace/save

You must make both the Debug and Release builds in cmake. You can either use nmake
or the IDE -- both will write the binary files to {emer}/bin/Debug or Release

Release Steps

* do the 64 bit build first (in Vista 64) then the 32 bit build -- so everything below
  is done in each bit size, except where indicated

* bring the project up to date, and make sure everything runs in Debug build

* Version (do this once, in the 64-bit build)
<OBSOLETE>
  * establish the new version number for this new release -- each new release MUST
    have a newer version number; ex if last release was 4.0.2 then it must
    be increased to at least 4.0.3 -- therefore, the Mac and Linux versions must 
    follow this rule as well
  * change VERSION string in config.h
  * change the file and product version numbers for:
    * temt library
    * emergent library
    * css app (css_bin)
    * emergent app (emergent_bin)
</OBSOLETE>
  * change the Version in the setup_bin
    The system will automatically offer to change the ProductCode and PackageCode, accept
    those -- DO NOT CHANGE THE UpgradeCode

* make the Release build, and make sure it works

* Build the Release and Debug versions of any adjunct plugins (note: only need
  to do 'nmake', no need to do 'install'):
  * audioproc

* the following need to be checked/updated in the setup_bin project -- open the 
  individual view panels, such as File System to add/change files -- note that you
  can look for new guys by sorting by date desc and comparing to last release date
  below (some will be changes, but there will be relatively few files newer than
  release date, so it is easy to compare them to the setup_bin list)
  * demo projects, and related files (ex Banana image)
  * prog_lib, css_lib
  * any new dlls, or if the version of dependent dlls changed, you will probably
    need to re-add the files

* make setup_bin -- unforutnately, this is a bit fussy, but the alternative of
  making 2 distinct setup projects would be vastly more complicated to maintain
  * 64 bit: 
    * in Properties/Prerequisites -- select Visual C++ Runtime x64; unselect x86
    * make sure the platform is x64
  * 32 bit: 
    * in Properties/Prerequisites -- select Visual C++ Runtime x84; unselect x64
    * make sure the platform is x86
  * make the Release version of the setup project
  * NOTE: sometimes VS puts in a SETUP.CAB that it shouldn't -- this is a huge
    file that just replicates the stuff in the .msi, so if that is there
    then delete it before making the zip

* Make a zip

  * use something like WinZip to make a .zip file of setup_bin\Release --
    don't make a folder, just put the files into a the root of a zip
  * rename the zip file like this (ex. for 4.0.9):
    emergent-4.0.9-x86.zip (or "x64" for 64 bit)
  * make a self-extracting archive from that zip file -- it will have a .exe suffix --
    for the default extract folder, enter 'setup' so the files unpack to their own
    folder (so they are not mixed in with any other files anywhere)

* Test as upgrade

  * the VMWare vm win_xp can be used to test the install -- it usually has the previous
    version installed, and has a Reset point set to before any pdp install
  * first test on the existing version -- it should install without any complaints about
    the version etc. (it does a silent upgrade)

* Test as virgin install
  * then, roll back the VM -- there should be no install of pdp
  * install again, and test

* We no longer make non SSE versions -- users will have to compile that themselves


* Upload finished .exe
  * scp it to grey in your home dir (ex. using WinSCP on Win box, or scp on linux)
  
'sudo cp' it to /home/ftp/pub/emergent
chmod go+r emergent-*

  * edit release template, to update:
