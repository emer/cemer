Lots of script changes to get packaging working for ubuntu 12.04 using the latest scripts which were intended to work for all releases and both qt4 and 5.

One change is that whereas before the BuildEmergent-ubuntu.sh script called ubuntu-motu-quarter it now calls either ubuntu-motu-quarter or conditionally unbuntu-motu-quarter-qt4. The version without the qt4 modifier expects qt5.

The ubuntu-motu-emergent script is a single version that handles the qt version conditionally.

These scripts can be run standalone, you don't need to call BuildEmergent-ubuntu first but it does some upfront work for you like checking out sources, etc.

As of this date we are still using qt4 for the ubuntu 12.04 packages and that is the main reason for continuing with qt4 on ubuntu
