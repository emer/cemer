Main Menu Redesign
 
Goals

* main menus and toolbars should be dynamic and primarily directive driven


Issues

* ordering: sometimes you want things inserted in certain locations
  we need to be able to specify the following:
    bottom: the item should always stay at the bottom (ex File/Quit)
    top: the item should always stay at the top
    "before X": item/group should go before X item/group
    "after X": item/group should go after X item/group
  
* grouping: sometimes you want things in groups, which will be set off 
  from other items with separators
  
* visible/invisible
* enabled/disabled
* check menus: some items are for checkmarks
* radio menus: group with mutually exclusive check items
* shortcuts (underline character)
* accelerators (control keys)
* menu icons
* toolbar icons
* menus and toolbars are distinct: need to have parallel set of directives
* what about modal or dynamic menus??? items that will appear or not
  depending on what user is doing, or what exists, etc.
* programmatic (script) access -- should be able to specify the action
  in gui-centric way, not requiring detailed knowledge of the object
* ellipses (...) for things invoking dialogs
Simplifying Assumptions or Restrictions

* groups should be intrinsic, and so apply to both menus and toolbars;
  this makes sense, particularly if grouping gets used for things like
  radio items, and for controlling insertion points
  
* some subitems are dynamic groups:
  ex. Windows list, Export To (different formats) etc.
  need a way to provide the entry for the dynamics, and then a way
  for the dynamic entries to be added/removed
  

Notes

* you only need to specify the shortcut for menu bar items once;
  maybe it should try to autocreate shortcuts where none specified


Comment Directives

The following directives are only for main menus and tool bars.
Note that unlike edit menu directives, all items on a main menu or toolbar
must be explicitly specified (there is no implicit placement.)


MMENU -- specified a main menu entry, use | to separate hierarchy
  ex. MMENU|File|New_Project
      MMENU|Tools|File_type|None
      

  
Location Directives

These directives provide hints on *where* to insert the item.
