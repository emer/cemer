Main Menu Redesign
 
Goals

* main menus and toolbars should be dynamic and primarily directive driven

Action Hierarchy

Here is the hiearchy of actions:

  * viewer -- intrinsic to the actual viewer gui itself
  * app -- these are global actions, on the root object -- they
    will appear on every top-level window (ex Help/About)
  * view -- these are created by the DataViewer class/subclass
  * root -- these are created by the root object type being shown
  * dynamic -- these are created dynamically, based on context

Issues

* ordering: sometimes you want things inserted in certain locations
  we need to be able to specify the following:
    bottom: the item should always stay at the bottom (ex File/Quit)
    top: the item should always stay at the top
    "before X": item/group should go before X item/group
    "after X": item/group should go after X item/group
  
* grouping: sometimes you want things in groups, which will be set off 
  from other items with separators
  
* visible/invisible (???)
* enabled/disabled
* check menus: some items are for checkmarks
* radio menus: group with mutually exclusive check items
* shortcuts (underline character)
* accelerators (control keys)
* menu icons
* toolbar icons
* menus and toolbars are distinct: need to have parallel set of directives
* what about modal or dynamic menus??? items that will appear or not
  depending on what user is doing, or what exists, etc.
* programmatic (script) access -- should be able to specify the action
  in gui-centric way, not requiring detailed knowledge of the object
* ellipses (...) for things invoking dialogs

Simplifying Assumptions or Restrictions

* there are no explicit separator directives (these were complicated)
  instead, separators are automatically inserted between groups

* groups should be intrinsic, and so apply to both menus and toolbars;
  this makes sense, particularly if grouping gets used for things like
  radio items, and for controlling insertion points
  
* some subitems are dynamic groups:
  ex. Windows list, Export To (different formats) etc.
  need a way to provide the entry for the dynamics, and then a way
  for the dynamic entries to be added/removed

* when a new item gets added to a group, it is always added at the end;
  i.e. there is no way to place items inside a group 

* dynamic submenus (ex window list) are only available on menus, not
  tool bar items? (maybe ok if they are on toolbuttons);
  these get populated in the "aboutToShow()" so there need not be any
  global mechanism to maintain the lists, increasing encapsulation
  and separation

* radio item groups maybe cannot be extensible (but maybe they could
  be if the method was virtual, and you added the inherited directives

Can't Do First Pass

* radio items in mainline menu items
  (but we should still be able to do them as submenus, that are 
  created in code)

* check items -- hard to define how to keep the check correct

Notes

* you only need to specify the shortcut for menu bar items once;
  maybe it should try to autocreate shortcuts where none specified

* might be possible to do radio groups by smushing all the items
  onto a single routine -- an attr indicates a radio item, and then
  the constr code has to manually scan the directives and grab
  all the items -- the grouping would be automatic, but you'd still
  need to add a grp directive to make sure you had the seps etc.


Comment Directives

The following directives are only for main menus and tool bars.
Note that unlike edit menu directives, all items on a main menu or toolbar
must be explicitly specified (there is no implicit placement.)
The "MM" root was chosen because menu items typically have numerous comment
directives, so something short is better than something descriptive.

MM -- specifies a main menu entry:
  use | to separate hierarchy
  use & prefix to specify shorcuts
  ex. MM_&File|New_Project
      MM_Tools|File_type|None

ACT -- specifies an action, for use on a main menu or toolbar -- the 
  method name in the action designator -- designators should be unique 
ACT_xxx -- specifies an action, for use on a menu or toolbar --xxx is 
  the action designator -- designators should be unique

MENU_GP_xxx -- specifies menu group; add to every entry that should be together
  ex. MENU_GP_FileProjActs -- groups have separators before/after

TB -- specifies a toolbar entry
  ex. TB_Default -- puts the action on the Default toolbar

Menu/Toolbar modifiers

IMG_xxx -- get a menu/toolbar icon from image called xxx, either a file or
   Qt resource uri
   ex. IMG_:/images/editcopy.png -- resource uri
       IMG_:images/myicon.png -- file uri, relative to app root

MENU_SUB -- the item is a submenu (probably dynamically populated)
  the menu method is called in the aboutToShow() routine, which can then
  populate the menu -- submenus that merely contain other action items
  do not need to be explicitly associated with a menu method

MENU_BEFORE_Xxx -- put this menu item before the indicated item OR group;
MENU_AFTER_Xxx -- put this menu item after the indicated item OR group;

MENU_FIRST -- always put this item first in its submenu or toolbar;
  if used more than once, the last item encountered is always first-most
MENU_LAST -- always put this item first in its submenu or toolbar;
  if used more than once, the last item encountered is always last-most

MENUGP_FIRST -- always put this group first in its submenu or toolbar;
  if used more than once, the last group encountered is always first-most;
  directive should be added to the first item in the group
MENUGP_LAST -- always put this group first in its submenu or toolbar;
  if used more than once, the last group encountered is always last-most;
  directive should be added to the first item in the group

ACT_ENABLE
ACT_CHECK -- is a checkable bool menu item
ACT_RADIO_0 -- is radio item, index 0 (0..N)

Menu Method Signatures

It is suggested that action methods should be created specifically for
this purpose, and not be combined with general application methods -- 
use an inline forward call if necessary.

It is suggested to name action methods as follows:
  ex. void EditCopyAction() -- does the "Edit/Copy" action





void MenuMethod_Simple() -- a simple action-based menu
void MenuMethod_DynSubMenu(taiSubMenu* submenu) -- a method that must populate a submenu 

int MenuMethod_Bool(bool checked) -- called with the *new* value of 'checked'
int MenuMethod_Radio(int radio) -- called with newly selected radio item
      

  
Location Directives

These directives provide hints on *where* to insert the item.

IMPLEMENTATION

First, the viewer will create a full list of actions.
Then, it will make the menus and toolbars.

MainMenuSpec:
  value type that holds all the relevant data for a mm item:
  name
  path -- the | name, with all pathing
  
DataViewer:

void Constr_Actions() -- enumerates all (static) actions, from all sources
void Constr_Actions_this() -- static actions, from ourself (viewer), ex. clip actions
void Constr_Actions_app_root() -- static actions, from the application root
void Constr_Actions_root() -- static actions, from the root object Type
void Constr_Actions_DataView() -- static actions, from our DataView

void Constr_MainMenu() -- main menu construction
void Constr_MainMenu_Base() -- for the base object (ourself)
void Constr_MainMenu_Root() -- for the root object
void Constr_MainMenu_Dynamic() -- for when the root state changes, ex. additional object,
  window lists, etc.
