Load Prog Lib bug

crash occurs as follows, in load of lib:

Program::Reset
 vars.Reset
   removal of item
     notify on the list re that item
       the clients list for that item seems to have an
       invalid entry (FastEl(i) on that item crashes)
      
it is actually the DataLink itself that must be invalid, since it has
several illegal values (prob random memory)

therefore, the taBase guy has his dl in his dl slot, when it has actually
been destroyed

this violates the invariant of validity of IDataLinkClient entries




debug T3 selection

leabra_ra.proj


if you delete top layer, then next layer
then select bottom layer,
you get a segfault on bottom layer in the 
iTabView::GetDataPanel() routine, for i = 5

caused because the i=5 panel is the one created for the item
previously selected then deleted -- that panel should
no longer be on the list, because the item i


after deleting the layer, when you click on the next layer,
the iTabView::AddPanel gets called twice with the same panel

an issue if we try to ActivatePanel based on link,
but we aren't matching panel exactly

why wasn't GetDataPanel returning the panel, based on link?
context:



* select Input layer

If you then delete it:

1. you don't get a Deselect event (so the T3 select list will now contain a zombie entry)
2. you get the following errors:
  removeChild: tried to remove non existent T3LayerNode
  removeChild: tried to remove non existent T3PrjnNode

2 implies that the node is being autodeleted before it is being manually deleted
