T3 Invariants:

* child node should only be removed from par node via absolute strict ref counts

* there are two ways to remove something:
  1. explicitly request it
  2. implicitly, via a clear() or delete of a group

now, if we control when a node is created, and when it is ref'ed, and when
  the parent node is deleted, we can control lifetime



debug T3 selection

leabra_ra.proj

context:

* select Input layer

If you then delete it:

1. you don't get a Deselect event (so the T3 select list will now contain a zombie entry)
2. you get the following errors:
  removeChild: tried to remove non existent T3LayerNode
  removeChild: tried to remove non existent T3PrjnNode

2 implies that the node is being autodeleted before it is being manually deleted
