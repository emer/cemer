rejig of batch notifies

currently:

all are passed to dl which sends to all clients

DataView accepts the batch st/ends, and tracks them

Other clients either ignore the starts, and accept ends,
or (like the DataTable bug in progeditor) ignore them


Issues/Requirements

* for general notifies, we can't use the parent approach
  used by dataviews, because parent updates don't necessarily
  cause updates to children

* need to redo in a way that is compatible with 
  legacy DataView (dv) stuff (ie should be transparent)


proposal:

* move the tracking stuff from Dataview to dl
* add a parent() guy to dl that will also be legacy
  compatible with what Dataview was doing
* since dv didn't do anything with the starts and
  non-0 ends, new dl approach doesn't need to do anything
* add end-of-batch ops
* dv looks for eob ops, makes the calls it used to do

* dlc should also specify if it wants eobs turned
  into item_updated (default) or sent
