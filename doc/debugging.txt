* occurs when you do the network rebuild, in the layer rebuild
happens on the EnforceLeaves(20) for the layer

the m_own is a UnitView object

problem is that the 
m_own->SmartRef_DataDestroying
actually causes the UnitView to be removed from the parent object, and destroyed;
therefore, when we get to the UAE call, it is destroyed

proposed fix:

* make temp copy of m_ptr
* NULL the m_ptr before notifying the client
* call client, passing the temp m_ptr, in case it needs it
* don't do anything after this call

* in taBase, put a default behavior of UAE in a base handler
