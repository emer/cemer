debug T3 selection

leabra_ra.proj

context:

* select Input layer

If you then delete it:

1. you don't get a Deselect event (so the T3 select list will now contain a zombie entry)
2. you get the following errors:
  removeChild: tried to remove non existent T3LayerNode
  removeChild: tried to remove non existent T3PrjnNode

2 implies that the node is being autodeleted before it is being manually deleted



calls to AddRemove:
