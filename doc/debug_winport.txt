maketa bug

Symptom



template bug

* treats the class name ok for the css stub function convert, but not in the 
  argument

* in Win, relates to call to C_Name in typedef, which due to parentage issues,
  ends up in an endpoint that returns the wrong name

what hasn't changed:

* the parser has not changed, therefore, assume it cannot be parser-related
* the lexer *has* changed
* the files are now crlf delimited

hypothesis:

* it is either related to subtle unfixed issues related to crlf files, or
  bug introduced by crlf fix

testing:

* should be able to test by using a unix file -- could run force_ta in cygwin mode
  note: used the msvc version of maketa, just ran it in cygwin context
* result: the files seem ok

* after converting file to unix lf's, the msvc version still generates the same files

hypothesis:

* try running using g++ but in msvc context
