Windows Compilation notes

VS Project Notes

Project Options
* change configurations to .Gui, .GuiDebug, etc. in the configurations tab
General
* change output directory to config directory

ZLIB
* install zlib1.dll, include files and lib from zlib.org

C++
  Preprocessor
  *  add necessary defines, ex. TA_NO_GUI, DEBUG, etc.
  Precompiled Headers
  * disable (TODO: seems to cause choking because we use .cc file ext,
    which vc++ seems to interpret as being or implying precompiled headers.)
  
  
MAKETA

* can't use the links to the ta files; must navigate to them and include in project
* Microsoft c compiler assumes C++ files have .cpp or .cxx extension 

COIN

* for cygwin/g++, had to make some #defines in 
  C:\Coin3D-2\include\Inventor\system\inttypes.h

CSS

* Posix functions not included in css_builtin.cc
* following functions not available in Windows:
  acosh, asinh, atanh, erf, erf_c

TAMISC

* TimeUsed -- all time assigned to usr (sys always 0)
