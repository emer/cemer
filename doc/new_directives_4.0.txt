OBJECT DIRECTIVES
-----------------

//TODO: revert this meaning, since we always had the EDIT_INLINE
#INLINE -- (existing directive) this now only controls inlining in the gui, not in dumping
//TODO: change this to DUMP_INLINE or SAVE_INLINE to be consistent with EDIT_INLINE
#INLINE_DUMP -- replaces INLINE for dump/load
#LABEL_ -- (same as item labels) -- can be used to rename types for the view system labels
#UAE_OWNER -- for taOBase-derivatives, causes UpdateAfterEdit to get sent to owner->ChildUpdateAfterEdit
#HIDDEN -- prevents type from showing in TypeHier lists
#CHILDREN_INLINE -- for lists, displays a compact inline form of children in edit panel
#NO_CHILDREN_INLINE -- forces use of the verbose member-based list view
#FILETYPE -- word used to describe files when saving/loading this type; should be a single noun, ex 'Project' (this directive is always used with the EXT directive)


ENUM DIRECTIVES (note: this is new)
---------------

#BITS -- indicates that the enum values are or'able bit fields -- gui will show series of check boxes, not a drop-down

ENUM ITEM DIRECTIVES (note: this is new)
---------------

#NO_BIT -- this is not a bit (typically used for OR'ed enums) -- usable in CSS, but doesn't show in gui


MEMBER DIRECTIVES
-----------------

#EXPERT -- show directive, like DETAIL etc.; especially for advanced parameters in net sims
#BROWSE -- shows the member in the browse view, particularly when it would otherwise be hidden.
#NO_BROWSE -- don't show the member in the browse view, particularly when it would otherwise be shown.
#INLINE -- puts an otherwise non-inline member class editor inline, esp. for Array
#VARTYPE_READ_ONLY -- user can only change value, not the type, of a Variant
#NO_VARTYPE_READ_ONLY -- user can change the type of a Variant
#ENUM_TYPE -- for TypeDef* members, indicates to show Enum types (deriving from xxx) in the interface;
  should still include a TYPE_xxx directive to anchor type
#EDIT_DIALOG -- for String types, adds a button for an editor dialog (for long strings)
#CONDEDIT -- added implicit bool semantics (including dotted submembers), as for Method GHOST


METHOD DIRECTIVES
-----------------

#ACTION_xxx -- marks the object as corresponding the indicated "well known" action, ex "editDelete" -- actions can have things like icons and accelerator keys.

#MENU_1N -- menu method that can be applied to 1 or more selected items; (note: method can have parameters, if so, then they are supplied in the usual fashion by a popup dialog)

#MENU_1_2N -- method that can be applied on 1st selected item, with items 2:N as a parameter; 1st parameter is the type of the object taken as a parameter (note: method can have more parameters, if so, then they are supplied in the usual fashion by a popup dialog)

#MENU_2N_1 -- method that can be applied on selected items 2:N with 1st item as a parameter; 1st parameter must be a pointer or reference to type of object 1 (note: method can have more parameters, if so, then they are supplied in the usual fashion by a popup dialog)

#MENU_CONTEXT -- puts the menu item directly on the context menu (instead of a submenu) -- ignored in edit dialogs and main menus.

#NO_MENU_CONTEXT -- does not put the item anywhere in a context menu.

#VMENU -- similar to MENU, but specifies a view item (for DataView classes) -- only VMENU items get put in View window menus. (Note: View items should generally not be edited as data items -- they are usually hidden in the browser hierarchy.)

#TYPE_ -- added this; same semantics as for members
#TYPE_ON_ -- added this; same semantics as for members
#GHOST_ -- added full value semantics, as for member CONDEDIT; implicit bool now also supports submembers (.); implicit bool supports any type: its Variant form is converted to bool
#EXT -- (3.x undocumented) as for Object directive, used for a stream (file) argument
#FILETYPE -- companion to EXT, see Object directive 

DEPRECATED DIRECTIVES
---------------------

OBJECT DIRECTIVES (DEPRECATED )
-----------------

#ARRAY_ALLOC -- wasn't used anywhere, and seemed unnecessary and possibly dangerous
