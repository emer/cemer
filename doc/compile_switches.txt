This file documents all the compiler switches, makefile variables, and environment variables that are used by the ta and pdp systems. Variable scope codes are indicated below, along with defaults:
  e -- environment (default is not applicable in environment)
  m -- makefile (default is applicable in a makefile)
  c -- compiler (default is applicable in source files)

Directory locations

Targets:

Target Subfolders:
.[Nogui/Gui][Mpi][Debug]

Module (lib/bin) suffix qualifiers:
[_nogui][_mpi][_debug]
  * suffix qualifiers for target-specific files/versions
  
Debugging

* the debug version of a module has "-dbg" appended to it

DEBUG 
  * forces generation and linking of a debuggable version
  * code won't be optimized
  * adds additional tests, and diagnostic messages
  
TA_PROFILE
  * adds internal statistics to a variety of classes
  * NOTE: always set when DEBUG is set
  
 
Gui

* the nogui version of a module has "-nog" appended to it;
  the "-nog" append precedes the "-dbg" append

TA_GUI
TA_NO_GUI
  * complementary switches, set when compiling for gui/no gui
  * controls all non-QtCore related dependencies
  * for nogui, there can be no Coin or non-QtCore dependencies

TA_USE_QT
  * this switch is set when linking with Qt
  * NOTE: THIS FLAG DOES NOT INDICATE GUI -- ex. ta is compiled with 
    the QtCore library, even for the non-gui version of the program
  
TA_USE_INVENTOR
  * this switch is set when compiling for gui and linking with Coin
  * this switch is really only used in the lowest level files
  * NOTE: Coin/Inventor is never used when building nogui
 
    
Mpi

* the MPI version of a module has "-mpi" appended to it;
  the "-mpi" append follows the "-nog" append

DMEM_COMPILE
  * set when compiling for MPI

 
Module Target

MOD_QUAL (m)
  * module qualifiers, appended to base name of library or executable
  * is empty for default, which is no debug, gui, no mpi
  
   
Maketa

__MAKETA__
  * defined when maketa is scanning the source code (headers)
  
   
Platform

These are the main platform switches:

WINDOWS -- Win32 or Win64
  * all Windows platforms use a Windows-based gui
DARWIN -- MacOS X
LINUX -- Linux
SOLARIS -- Sun Solaris

[MORE TBD]

These are also defined under the given conditions:
UNIX -- for any Unix platform, including MacOS X
  * all Unix platforms use X Windows-based gui
WIN32 -- for 32 bit Windows
WIN64 -- for 64 bit Windows


Architecture

These are the architecture switches:

I386 -- Intel i386
X86_64 -- AMD/Intel 64 bit
IA64 -- Intel Itanium (64 bit)
PPC -- Power PC (any version)
PPC32 -- Power PC, 32 bit
PPC64 -- Power PC, 64 bit

Word Size

TA_32BIT -- defined for all 32 bit targets
TA_64BIT -- defined for all 64 bit targets
  

Makefile Variables

TARG_DEFINES
  * modal -Dxx defines, depending on target
  
TARG_LIBS
  * modal -lxxx defines, based on target (ex mpi, lqt, etc.)

Deprecated Switches

The following switches appeared in 3.2, and are deprecated:

CYGWIN -- the Windows version no longer requires Cygwin
  * some code fragments may remain with this switch -- it is
    ok to leave those for the time being
    
    
Misc

TA_NO_EXCEPTIONS -- defined if system should be built without C++ exceptions
