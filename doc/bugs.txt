WORK PRIORITY
-------------

---------------
Alpha:

Brad:

misc ui improvements:
* read-only, condedit off guys in edits are just labels, not controls
* add ... to edit a token pointer (replaces #93)
* text controls have minimum width
* minimal netview cleanup: transparent layer etc
* bug fixes and replacements for the arg dialogs, and replacing ItemChooser based guys (esp New dialog!).
* dnd extended to applying things: drag a layerspec and drop it on a layer
  and this sets the layerspec.  need to just parse member funs that take
  layerspec args + comment dir to disambiguate (or just pop up menu).

* Program ControlPanel: extend list view for programs + their vars/args + add buttons for selected guy + step_prog + global_vars
* tabs for 3d views - required for these next guys (simple version):
* matrix view of datatable (in 3d/inventor)

* ChangeType/UpdatePointers etc. gui patches
* virtual console dock window, ex. be able to dock to bottom of any project window

* startup pathing cleanup + platform params: redo pdproot/main code + randy

Graphing/Viewing:
* sort out DT/DA specs vs. TableView etc.
* get working, including support for matrices
  * T3 graphs  
  * T3 table views
  * T3 grid views

Others to Prioritize:

* #99 (improper Mac prompt on Quit)

Brad done:
* dnd icon bar for: progedit
* shutdown cleanup + add window menu
* remove extra scrollbar on console 
* move edit dialog menus & buttons outside of the different panel sets in an edit
* #CAT_ support for method, member choosers: simple is just column (1st col). bonus is menu..
* fixed tab activating bugs
* #CAT_ support for types
* buttons have maximum width (20 chars, established in taiMisc::InitMetrics)
* T3 tabs should update if name changes
* highlight progeditor lines w/red for ProgEl->CheckConfig == false #70

Brad deferred:
* add window menu (not hi pri, since likely only 2 or 3 wins anyway)
* yellow surround for non-default values (NOTE: non-defaults already use BOLD captions)

Randy:

* reactivating basic wizard stuff for env + procs
* add item / change name of objs guy update var: modify DataChanged on *list* object to 
  trap and call fun.  name change is less clear: brad to add datachanged in taBase to check
  owner for comment directive of "update me when child edited"
* add #CAT + better desc for lots of core stuff
* Datatable aggregation
* GNU Scientific library integration + image processing (highvis) (imagereader + qt image readers)
* Function libraries + "IncludeCodeEl"
* export data tables and matrixes (including incremental output) 
* profiler!
* -nogui
* dmem


---------------
Beta (feature complete, bugfix to release):

* hover notes to add methoddef desc info in MethodCall, etc..
* multiple selection across views/trees, etc & actions (toolbars) that become
  activated in response to multiple selections: build out list of possible
  actions by walking typedefs & looking at comment directives; traverse
  list each time selection is updated and activate actions that match.  
  order matters.
* add "pin/unpin" capability to panels, and extend panel tab context menu 
* dnd icon bar for:
  netview/designer
* network layer shortcut view: "sheet view" & iconify.
* key shortcuts, particularly to invoke a string editor for string fields (all of them)
* multi-cpu


---------------
Omega:

* import data tables and matrixes
* record scripts for gui operations: requied for dmem operation in gui mode.
* revamp the 3D display of net objects: smart projection pointers,
  etc....
* 4-panel view of network, to enable rational moving/sizing of objects
  - the moving/sizing
* Printing Analysis, Design, and Implementation -- MAJOR


Deferred:

Done:
* integrated viewers
* dnd

BUGS
----

Serious/Fatal:

* new bug: external dest of a cut/paste has segment fault when it tries to do the remdatataken (but the source
  call of this functionality works fine)
* when deleting an open tree item, prompts "Apply Changes" -- cancel then crashes
* ex. in Networks, delete the network -- moves up to .networks node, but still shows the deleted network in the group portion of the Networks edit panel (if you make a new browser, the .networks edit panel correctly shows no child networks in its group)
* (??? maybe fixed) "wrong sizing behavior on group items in group edits" (bug text transcribed from written sheet -- may not be applicable any more)
* UI often hangs -- one incident could be tracked to a line iTabBar::paint, where it calls inherited
  just after setting pallete -- MAYBE CAN'T DO THIS RELIABLY
* when pasting a new item into a list view, the text shows up as the previous item,
  not the new item (but it is correct if you open a new browser and view it there)
* (FIXED?) browser: clip handling not working in tree view
* t3viewer: clip handling not working:
  ex., Projection doesn't have its proper clip actions, ex Delete
  caused because code gets the parent link from the visual object (NetView), not the 
  containing object (taGroup)
* in Chapter2/units.prj -- the Settle/LoopProc does not indicate the name of the script
  (but did in v3.2); also, this project is not working, and probably has to do with this script;
  note: doesn't even indicate script is loaded even when the script folder is current folder
* MAKETA: under win32-msvc build (maybe others), typedef's must have a trailing comment, otherwise
  the parser gets out of sync and the force_ta will fail
* program crashes when deleting project
  context: had main window, NetView, and a separate browse of XOR net open
  deleted proj; caused a seg fault (in some Qt code, related to painting)
* in Scripts, once you have a script file set, you can't seem to get it to 
  reload the file (make changes to the file, select Open again, but it 
  still retains the first contents.)
* this seems to happen after one or more load errors have occurred, and you deleted
  the project and tried again:
  load fails with segfault in MemberDef::Dump_Load -- ex. was "epoch" (a var on net);
  debugger indicates it has invalid data in its owner (MemberSpace); seems likes some
  kind of memory corruption
* on load of xor_2006-07-07_3.proj.gz --
  "Attempt to create type of "Program" in list of type "Program_MGroup" -- most of the
  programs seem to load, but the first, Train prog doesn't have its correct name, only
  the generic name -- progs in the subgroup seem to load fine
* HIGH PRIORITY: the pathing in pdpshell.cpp is utterly broken and needs revamping!!!!!
* if you specify a project on the cmd line, it keeps reopening the same proj repeatedly
* last data item missing in .projects group view (view_colors) --
  the label is there, but  not the data control (perhaps this is why the names don't line up)
  -- when you just look at the property panel directly (the project itself) it does show
  the view_colors control properly
  NOTE: if you view .defaults though, there are 4 props that show correctly, although
  the labels still don't line up properly
-- post qt4 browser:
* in xor.proj, try using Move from edit panel item menu for the Train subgroup;
  causes segfault -- stack indicates that Move is being called with NULL item pointers,
  so somehow, between the arg dialog, and the css_stub call, the chosen items are
  not being passed
  
* when doing Close Project with network in viewer, segfaults in taiDataHost::DeleteLater(obj)
  -- the body (obj) seems to be invalid at this point
  -- note: there are numerous nested Struct/DataUpdate calls, including ones caused by
    deeply nested guys (ex. Layer.projections) on Network
  * it is likely that the taiEditDataHost already destroyed the gui stuff, but the body etc.
    are still hanging around able to do mischief BAD


Medium Important:

* in Browser, no-name items now showing empty tab (should show generic name, ie "Unit[0]")
* can't seem to drag 3 items from listview -- only first 2 items seem to get dragged
* don't repeatedly create new tabs for changed items if one such tab already exists
* SelEdit: when you change the Mbr labels from the menu item, the Accept/Cancel gets lit up on the seledit dialog
* SelEdit: dialog should rebuild after changing labels
* In DataTable in browser, table indicates (ex) 10 rows, but each float_RArray only
  indicates 1 in its 'size' member.
* in maketa/win32-msvc it is adding spurious ta_Init_() call to ta files --
  worked around by adding that as a dummy function in ta_type.h, but it is a bug that 
  needs to be fixed (see mta_constr.cc line 1080)
* when calling up Properties for int_Array, size shows as 1, even though it is greater
* when you load an object from file, if the object is named, its name will show 
  correctly in the panel, but will still have its default name (ex "MyType_0") in the tree view
* for LayerWriter, TARG is not getting pulled from Layer
* if you put a function in your Program that has the same name as a method on
  the object, horrible things happen (first discovered when __Init() was called
  Init() and there is also a Program::Init() ) -- see the fixed log below for more
  details -- it seems to cause some horrible corruption that is then difficult to
  diagnose what is happening
* if you choose a non-gz proj file to save to, it warns about overwriting, but then
  it just writes to a .gz file, leaving your non-gz file as it was
* if you rename a panel object, its name is correct in panel and tree, but you still have
  the old name showing in the description are at the top of the panel
* selected several items in list view in .defaults (XOR proj) and selected Delete from menu;
  program just hung, CPU indicated idle, but kdbg didn't include "Break" option to stop prog;
  hit Run (?), and then kdbg indicated Segfault, Stack indicated inside rl_getc then sys calls;
  note that recover file indicated that the last default selected had been deleted;
  ADDENDUM: was able to reproduce by just loading test-prog_06-07-07_1 and deleting the two
  defaults, segfaulting in the iListDataPanel::EditAction routine, enumerating (backwards)
  the second item, ie item 0 of 2 items; segfaulted on the ISelectable::EditAction call;
  note: single item delete works ok; and previous notes here indicate that the first item
  iterated works ok (ie last item of selection is deleted), so it is subsequent item that
  is failing;
  note: other ops, like Copy multiple work ok (you can verify using clipview)
* closed project w/ net viewer open; got series of Coin resource error msgs in output;
  Coin raised an Abort 
* there needs to be appropriate scoping for selecting objects in MethodCallEl -- right
  now, it is just global, so you can grab vars not in scope
* had netviewer open, had opened several tabs on it to view layers, and XOR net itself 
  (the visibile tab); had another viewer open rooted on XOR net; closed it, mysterious
  seg fault in taPtrList_impl::Remove (but nothing else indicated on Stack)
* filer and related:
  * when clicking on Network->SaveAs menu, no default file in dialog
    (prob because still using the stream-based api, not the file-based)
* in Script, when I load a script file, the Run button is not enabled
  (check the other buttons as well, enabling does not seem correct -- might
   be related to new enabling semantics for ghost)
* create a new matrix; choose SetGeomN from menu and change; panel is not updated;
  only when you click to something else and return does panel show correct values
* using standard QTableView when values are numeric-ish seems to insert an up/down
  edit control, which is limited to 2 decimal digits maximum
* in EditPanel view of lists (with multi-grid), names not lining up to values 
* if you close a project, the panel you are on remains open until you click on the
  empty .projects item (this may presumably also apply to lesser items, although
  usually you have to click on the item to action it, so it may be masked)
-- post qt4 browse:
* open xor.proj; click on "specs" to open; XORUnitSpec edit panel has some kind of
  context menu open (looks like one of the data control TypeDef Menu thingies);l
  note: does not happen for the Con or Prjn spec items
* progedit -- needs scrollview for the edit frame, because it just renders out into
  the hidden area of the window, so you have to size window big enough to see it
* DRAG AND DROP!
  

Lower Priority (but perhaps still needed)

* if you change the Geom on a Matrix, the Edit display is not correct

Cosmetic/Usability/etc. (lower priority):

* font for iAction-created taiMenuEl items is not being inherited from the parent taiMenu item
* boxes in edit panels don't shrink as much as they could
* should be bigger gap from labels to data in editpanels
* right or middle click to create a new tab in browser
* may want to add auto-line splitting to object descriptions <- YES! this is particularly important for SimLog dialog upon saving, which has a very long title, and occludes the buttons, etc
* change default name in NetMonItem to just NetMonItem (no _#) because we qualify every name anyway
  and the numbers will just get out of sync with list position anyway
* need to add clipboard/drag/drop awareness to TableViews
* Project Open dialog doesn't reopen using your previous directory
* "Create New Object" dialog opens parented to root window, so it changes focus
* browsers don't really have proper title, i.e. now they all say "root()" or "root() <N>" etc
-- post qt4 browse:
* fix the damned desc control so it sizes out to the end of the panel
* add the buttons to the bottom (same as on the edit properties)
* add a script panel to Programs so user just needs to click button to view script
* taiField controls should have a min size, ex. see the List properties for colorspecs,
  the color values are barely 1 numeral wide

TODO
----
* menu changes to main menu, + context menu

* finish the "over max" handlers in several menu types
* finish the item/group checking code for rebuilds in gpiList datahost types
* in group view on edits, :
  1-scroll by item
  2-option to even show all the group items; off by default
* Color Bar controls
* browser view state (cf Project View State, member of .project)

* reordery dialog (ex for SelectEdit order)
iEditGrid:
* vertical separators in iEditGrid
* fixed vert cell sizes in iEditGrid (ex. 2 or 3 for the window)
* maybe need to use manual by-cell scrolling for iEditGrid, instead of automatic visual-scrolling
* accommodate more than one edit panel viewed side-by-side (ex in a splitter)
* save/load configuration of browser (with proj)
* AND/OR (maybe for new) create a default view of tabs used for projects, ex. specs, networks, etc. (project view stuff)
* HIPRI: any moving of Programs around pretty much needs to dirty ALL Progs, since they use
  pathing to do calls and inits, and thus those paths will now have changed
* HIPRI taiStreamArgType has to have its filtering etc updated because of taFiler changes

CLIP/DRAGDROP

* prob have to own item before loading OR PREFERABLY maybe call load on parent instead
* default support for #LINKGROUP


DONE (shown in reverse order, top=most recent)
----
* closing secondary browser windows was crashing -- was caused by incorrect delayed 
  close logic; fixed
* fixed all the registration issues in iEditGrid, including those introduced with
  the addition of CompactEdit -- also cleaned up some longstanding minor layout issues
* in a Matrix, select Remove Frame(n) for some n inside the matrix; the core
  works correctly, but the Gui seems to lob off all the frames from n on
* in Script, when you compile, the "script compiled" check does not get checked
* when you have the CompactEdit panel, and add items from its menu, they don't show up
  in the item area at the bottom (ex. ProgVar, edit the DynEnum items, try adding items)
  NOTE: this was just a DynEnum class problem, because of DataChanged not forwarding; fixed
* pdp is leaving the launch shell in half-duplex output mode (it is not echoing what you type)
* need to do GetImage on other panels when the data changed or reverted
* secondary view windows, "File/Close Browser" doesn't work
* stripes continue in body but not names in iEditGrid
* create a new (string) Matrix; set some dims; switch to Edit panel, it ABORTS
* byte_Matrix data entry, seems to accept as if Hex, then display in Decimal
* Project::file_name (taFNBase) should prob not show, and def not save filename
* filer and related:
  * saved a proj to name.proj and it actually saved to name.proj.gz
  * made a new proj; selected file/save and it saved it without prompt
    to BpProject_1.proj.gz (should have prompted, using that name)
  * SaveAll menu missing
* overall application: Expert Mode vs. Novice (to control complexity/visibility)
* created a new program subgroup from menu;
  went to its property sheet, renamed it;
  the group disappeared from the tree; but opening in a new tree the renamed group is there
* abstract out the CONDEDIT processing code and enable the same capabilities for
  GHOST (for buttons); you can look for ":" to enable a backwards-compatability mode
* just adding ex. a UserScriptEl to init_els doesn't dirty the Program
* trying to compile a program that hit the following error line:
yyparse(): css_parse.y line 797
  yyerror("const type not accepted in this context");
  nests down into: cssProg::Reset(); cssSpace::Reset(); then into
  cssEl::unRefDone(); causes seg fault in debug code when 
  accessing GetName() of 'it' ('it' is valid address)
  'it' had address 6e2a08 which suggest in static program data area
  major confound: can't find an implementation of yyerror
   and in the code, it is calling cssProgSpace.Reset ????
* NOTE: when CSS assigns a value, if it has a TA parent, it does UAE on that
  parent, so, ex. when we have Program::ret_value, when the program assigns
  value to ret_value, the Program gets a UAE! this is not expected!!!
  Issues:
  1) not expected UAEs
  2) confound between design-time UAE's for things like changing prog,
     vs. runtime UAEs for things like prog values changing
* (at least) in Variant ui for int, the spinbox can only go up to 99
* when loading a project, the list view says "Project_0" even if it has a different name, ex. "Proj"
* project, t3views not reopening properly, in OnWindowOpen_impl of NetView, attempt to open
  panel fails because NetView's datalink returns NULL (probably not being properly linked
  during load, vs. new in program)
* in proj.viewers -- have open viewer, then close that viewer; causes exception in
  iDataBrowser::GetEditAction at point of accessing cur_item -- maybe cur_item has not been properly
  changed or NULL'ed.
  Also happens if you are only in browser window; ex. have 2 projects loaded; sel 2nd project in tree,
  then select Close from the item menu.
* main menus no longer working (ex File/Quit); but corresponding accel keys do invoke the command (ex Ctrl-Q for File/Quit)
* main edit menus no longer enabling properly; but context menu has correct items shown
--2005-02-05--
* root::SaveSettings causes crash (NOTE: doesn't seem to be happening anymore)
* if a ListViewPanel has been made, then program crashes on shutdown
* multi-DD/clip
* make sure that buttons and button menu methods can be accessed on context menu, and
  main menu when no edit dialog
* add directive to enable context menus to have methods in the root menu, not in a submenu
* need to raise a DATA CHANGED when a list is sorted
* CUT and UNLINK s/b mutually exclusive
* .processes etc. have comment directives to hide things like subprocesses; should be shown in browser
* "no" version of "BROWSE" directive
--2004-11-19--
* data handling for clipboard and D/D
* finish cut/paste for groups
** directive-based way to show ex. subgroup members in tree, but ex. remain Detail in Edit
* use Transfer for Cut/Paste in process; Copy/Paste/Delete source  for Cut/Paste across apps
--2004-11-12--
* alpha completion of clipboard/dragdrop
--2004-11-01--
* need to do a GetImage before reshowing a tab panel
* default for enums (iComboBox)
* right-select New should open item in a dialog ( otherwise should be set in tree ???)
* in the SelEdit context menus, always include all seledits, and just enable/disable them (so user gets nice positional stability)
* can't size EditPanel section smaller than a full panel (no scroll bars)
* TrainEpoch class has too-long desc, not broken by \n
* BrowserWin doesn't seem to be constrained in size
* can't shrink the browser when its panel area has been widened very wide
--10/22/04--
* in editpanels, full version of help text (ex. enums, subtypes)
* SelectEdit add func causes crash
* iCoord edit
* Seledit extra labels not being shown for data or for functions
* in SelEdit, only puts menubutton items on correct button when their button name is in the directive (because normal edits depend on the most recent cur_item being valid)
