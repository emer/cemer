BUGS
----

Serious/Fatal:

* new bug: external dest of a cut/paste has segment fault when it tries to do the remdatataken (but the source
  call of this functionality works fine)
* need to do GetImage on other panels when the data changed or reverted
* when deleting an open tree item, prompts "Apply Changes" -- cancel then crashes
* ex. in Networks, delete the network -- moves up to .networks node, but still shows the deleted network in the group portion of the Networks edit panel (if you make a new browser, the .networks edit panel correctly shows no child networks in its group)
* (??? maybe fixed) "wrong sizing behavior on group items in group edits" (bug text transcribed from written sheet -- may not be applicable any more)
* UI often hangs -- one incident could be tracked to a line iTabBar::paint, where it calls inherited
  just after setting pallete -- MAYBE CAN'T DO THIS RELIABLY
* when pasting a new item into a list view, the text shows up as the previous item,
  not the new item (but it is correct if you open a new browser and view it there)
* (FIXED?) browser: clip handling not working in tree view
* t3viewer: clip handling not working:
  ex., Projection doesn't have its proper clip actions, ex Delete
  caused because code gets the parent link from the visual object (NetView), not the 
  containing object (taGroup)
* in Chapter2/units.prj -- the Settle/LoopProc does not indicate the name of the script
  (but did in v3.2); also, this project is not working, and probably has to do with this script;
  note: doesn't even indicate script is loaded even when the script folder is current folder
* MAKETA: under win32-msvc build (maybe others), typedef's must have a trailing comment, otherwise
  the parser gets out of sync and the force_ta will fail
* program crashes when deleting project
  context: had main window, NetView, and a separate browse of XOR net open
  deleted proj; caused a seg fault (in some Qt code, related to painting)
* trying to compile a program that hit the following error line:
yyparse(): css_parse.y line 797
  yyerror("const type not accepted in this context");
  nests down into: cssProg::Reset(); cssSpace::Reset(); then into
  cssEl::unRefDone(); causes seg fault in debug code when 
  accessing GetName() of 'it' ('it' is valid address)
  'it' had address 6e2a08 which suggest in static program data area
  major confound: can't find an implementation of yyerror
   and in the code, it is calling cssProgSpace.Reset ????
* in Scripts, once you have a script file set, you can't seem to get it to 
  reload the file (make changes to the file, select Open again, but it 
  still retains the first contents.)
  
Medium Important:

* in Browser, no-name items now showing empty tab (should show generic name, ie "Unit[0]")
* secondary view windows, "File/Close Browser" doesn't work
* can't seem to drag 3 items from listview -- only first 2 items seem to get dragged
* don't repeatedly create new tabs for changed items if one such tab already exists
* SelEdit: when you change the Mbr labels from the menu item, the Accept/Cancel gets lit up on the seledit dialog
* SelEdit: dialog should rebuild after changing labels
* In DataTable in browser, table indicates (ex) 10 rows, but each float_RArray only
  indicates 1 in its 'size' member.
* in maketa/win32-msvc it is adding spurious ta_Init_() call to ta files --
  worked around by adding that as a dummy function in ta_type.h, but it is a bug that 
  needs to be fixed (see mta_constr.cc line 1080)
* when calling up Properties for int_Array, size shows as 1, even though it is greater
* when you load an object from file, if the object is named, its name will show 
  correctly in the panel, but will still have its default name (ex "MyType_0") in the tree view
* for LayerWriter, TARG is not getting pulled from Layer
* just adding ex. a UserScriptEl to init_els doesn't dirty the Program
  
Cosmetic/Usability/etc. (lower priority):

* font for iAction-created taiMenuEl items is not being inherited from the parent taiMenu item
* stripes continue in body but not names in iEditGrid
* boxes in edit panels don't shrink as much as they could
* should be bigger gap from labels to data in editpanels
* right or middle click to create a new tab in browser
* may want to add auto-line splitting to object descriptions

TODO
----
* menu changes to main menu, + context menu

* finish the "over max" handlers in several menu types
* finish the item/group checking code for rebuilds in gpiList datahost types
* in group view on edits, :
  1-scroll by item
  2-option to even show all the group items; off by default
* Color Bar controls
* browser view state (cf Project View State, member of .project)
* overall application: Expert Mode vs. Novice (to control complexity/visibility)

* reordery dialog (ex for SelectEdit order)
iEditGrid:
* vertical separators in iEditGrid
* fixed vert cell sizes in iEditGrid (ex. 2 or 3 for the window)
* maybe need to use manual by-cell scrolling for iEditGrid, instead of automatic visual-scrolling
* accommodate more than one edit panel viewed side-by-side (ex in a splitter)
* save/load configuration of browser (with proj)
* AND/OR (maybe for new) create a default view of tabs used for projects, ex. specs, networks, etc. (project view stuff)

CLIP/DRAGDROP

* prob have to own item before loading OR PREFERABLY maybe call load on parent instead
* default support for #LINKGROUP

DONE (shown in reverse order, top=most recent)
----

* (at least) in Variant ui for int, the spinbox can only go up to 99
* when loading a project, the list view says "Project_0" even if it has a different name, ex. "Proj"
* project, t3views not reopening properly, in OnWindowOpen_impl of NetView, attempt to open
  panel fails because NetView's datalink returns NULL (probably not being properly linked
  during load, vs. new in program)
* in proj.viewers -- have open viewer, then close that viewer; causes exception in
  iDataBrowser::GetEditAction at point of accessing cur_item -- maybe cur_item has not been properly
  changed or NULL'ed.
  Also happens if you are only in browser window; ex. have 2 projects loaded; sel 2nd project in tree,
  then select Close from the item menu.
* main menus no longer working (ex File/Quit); but corresponding accel keys do invoke the command (ex Ctrl-Q for File/Quit)
* main edit menus no longer enabling properly; but context menu has correct items shown
--2005-02-05--
* root::SaveSettings causes crash (NOTE: doesn't seem to be happening anymore)
* if a ListViewPanel has been made, then program crashes on shutdown
* multi-DD/clip
* make sure that buttons and button menu methods can be accessed on context menu, and
  main menu when no edit dialog
* add directive to enable context menus to have methods in the root menu, not in a submenu
* need to raise a DATA CHANGED when a list is sorted
* CUT and UNLINK s/b mutually exclusive
* .processes etc. have comment directives to hide things like subprocesses; should be shown in browser
* "no" version of "BROWSE" directive
--2004-11-19--
* data handling for clipboard and D/D
* finish cut/paste for groups
** directive-based way to show ex. subgroup members in tree, but ex. remain Detail in Edit
* use Transfer for Cut/Paste in process; Copy/Paste/Delete source  for Cut/Paste across apps
--2004-11-12--
* alpha completion of clipboard/dragdrop
--2004-11-01--
* need to do a GetImage before reshowing a tab panel
* default for enums (iComboBox)
* right-select New should open item in a dialog ( otherwise should be set in tree ???)
* in the SelEdit context menus, always include all seledits, and just enable/disable them (so user gets nice positional stability)
* can't size EditPanel section smaller than a full panel (no scroll bars)
* TrainEpoch class has too-long desc, not broken by \n
* BrowserWin doesn't seem to be constrained in size
* can't shrink the browser when its panel area has been widened very wide
--10/22/04--
* in editpanels, full version of help text (ex. enums, subtypes)
* SelectEdit add func causes crash
* iCoord edit
* Seledit extra labels not being shown for data or for functions
* in SelEdit, only puts menubutton items on correct button when their button name is in the directive (because normal edits depend on the most recent cur_item being valid)
