Qt4 Port TODO Items


ta_qtclipdata.h/cpp

* port to new Qt4 mime/drag class framework

ta_qttype.h/cpp

* in taiArgType -- need to revise for the recently added types

ta_qtgroup.cpp

* fixup SelectEdit menu populating -- maybe do via comment directives?

ta_qtviewer.h/cpp

* port to new model/view architecture
* test splitting/joining of panels


BUGS

* inline xyz editor not being properly centered
* in default display panel, the group view is not displaying, 
  but it does display when using "properties" (separate window)

* create a DataTable in data; give it a name in Properties; press Apply
  error msg occurs (like "Cannot save, list size has changed")
* List/Group bug: when adding a new item, it appears first as "[N]TypeName" 
  even if given a name -- it only displays correct name if something updates
  the view, ex. adding a new item (test using DataTable and adding cols)
* taMisc::Error -- doesn't raise error dialog (note: requiring the *** to raise
  interactive dialogs is a terrible convention...)
* when moving an item in a list via drag/drop, the item ends up getting deleted
  (note: code seems correct in taList, i.e. it does execute the Move op --
   maybe the source is incorrectly deleting it)
* per above, also, when cancelling a drag op, the item still disappears!
* drop context menu not in correct place
* drop context menu not showing up when dropping on another object somewhere
* ** idle program seems to actively leak memory (can possibly be a quitted
  version, where the ui is gone, but the program hasn't quit yet)
  
* Show menu, enabling logic is correct, but doesn't seem to do anything
  CAUSE: seems to relate to delay in dispatching the deleted() signal from the
    defer delete components in the body -- Qt docs say it dispatches those in the
    event loop, but only when returning to a specific event loop, so maybe we 
    rarely hit the condition of recalling ProcessEvents in the same event loop
    
* app not quiting from command line,  it displays console prompt
* in iEditGrid (used in ta_qtgroup) there is an ugly hack to workaround a
  seeming bug in QGridLayout->setRowMinimumHeight
  NOTE: still not working right!


NetViewer
* nothing in "Display" mini-window
* rotary controls not displaying images
  (may be related to the qtassistant in this buildof Qt not showing icons)


ISSUES

taiAction 

* lifetime management is not correct -- possibly can't use a refcounted approach
ambiguity:
 - what happens when you add a QAction to a widget? it needs to be referenced, right?
The owner/creator of the Action will control the lifetime of its container,
ex. taiMenuToolBarBase
* if we manage lifetime via a ref count, we cannot also have parent-managed lifetime,
  IF the parent-managed lifetime can be shorter than the ref counted one
* QAction is a QObject derivitive; presumably, only for lifetime management


curSel

set: by code, to cause the item to become current
  by the user, when the user selects an item
cleared: when moving one item to another

when the user selects an item:
code must retrieve previous item, and deselect (could be on another menu)

when Action is added, we can detect if it participates in global selection:
  is radio && not in a local group
  
item toggling/setting/resetting can occur:
* because user clicked it
* because code is unsetting it due to new curSel
* because code is unsetting it due to user clicking new item
* because code is setting it

do we need to do anything, really, for toggle???


Events for use cases

Code changes curSel
  if exist, code sets check off for cur
    cur will raise its toggle() signal
      toggle(false) handler for cur will run
      
User selects a new radio item in menu
  item will raise its toggle(true) signal
  
things we should ignore:
  toggles for local radio group items
  toggles for toggle items
  
things we should act on:
  toggles for global radio group items
