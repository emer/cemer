Graphing 

NEED TO TEST
* AxisSpec, ColSpec, GraphSpec notifications on changes 

BUGS
* when doing UAE's, need to redraw the graphs (only rebuilding, not redrawing)
* 3D color bar placement

HI PRI
* raster mode
* multiple graphlets

LO PRI
* click captions (click to get box with text of values at nearest line)
* permit simple setting of the axis for the column
* border between GB's
* GB check box paint area spills over onto axis area (when no button)


taDataView/T3DataView

* concept of "clear" is wrong -- shouldn't delete the node_so in data views
* poor factoring between ta and T3, leads to need to test for par class type
  in many T3 contexts (ex. see GraphViews::Clear_impl)
  
  
GENERAL

* need a user-friendly Color Gui picker for edit dialogs (instead/in addition to
  the manual r/g/b) -- edit gui should show color, not just the rgb values
  
WIZARD

* need a general framework for wizards
  * outer dialog
  * pages
  * page navigation, including navigability constraints
