Issues for Table edits

 
BUGS

* sometimes the text doesn't show up after declicking a ctrl
  ex. AdvancedControlPanel when you click the complex guy,
  then click the label, the text is blank
  (prolly relates to dat still hanging around when the Paint
    occurs; and this is the result of editor not being close
    see TODO)
  
TODO:

* editor is currently not destroying! (except for esc)
  * need to detect when field is exited, and then 
    emit the closeEditor signal
    
* much better text version of guys;
  *possibly formatted vs. "raw" -- you can have formatted for
  display, then "raw" when you edit
  * check if it supports rich (html) text
