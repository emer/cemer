Clip Changes


On/Between 

* in QAbstractItemView::dragMoveEvent

* drop valid/invalid and drop rect/line are independent --
  the rect/line in does in QAbstractItemView::dragMoveEvent
  but you could change the event's drop action!

* position type (Above etc.) determined thus:
  1. get index from pos: indexAt(pos)
  2. get rect from index:  visualRect(index)
  3. get type from pos and rect d->position(pos, rect) @@
note: dropIndicatorPosition should be available in protected
  mode after this event


Probably Needed Overrides:

* always for the drop action to be the same ("Move") --
  

Key impl routines:


model::supportedDropActions()
  - dynamically queried in dragMove to determine
     proposed action or Ignore

model::flags()
  is: TreeModel::flags(), which is nonvirt 
  TreeItem::flags which is data


Proposed Changes

dragMoveEvent
  Pre:
  * change proposedAction via
     setDropAction
  Post:
  * use this->indicatorPosition and index/pos
    to determine actual enable status of operation
  * if operation not allowed, then ignore event

TEST:

* make changes to dragMove
* disable "before/after" operations
* check item for "on" operations
* resulting behavior should be same as clipboard op enabling
