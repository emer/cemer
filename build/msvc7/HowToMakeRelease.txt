How To Make an Emergent Release

notes: 
  * when you change from Debug to Release or vv you must touch config.h to force remaketa
    just open config.h, add space/backspace/save

Release Steps

* bring the project up to date, and make sure everything runs in Debug build

* Version
  * establish the new version number for this new release -- each new release MUST
    have a newer version number; ex if last release was 4.0.2 then it must
    be increased to at least 4.0.3 -- therefore, the Mac and Linux versions must 
    follow this rule as well
  * change the file and product version numbers for:
    * temt library
    * emergent library
    * css app (css_bin)
    * emergent app (emergent_bin)
  * change the Version in the setup_bin
    The system will automatically offer to change the ProductCode and PackageCode, accept
    those -- DO NOT CHANGE THE UpgradeCode

* make the Release build, and make sure it works

* the following need to be checked/updated in the setup_bin project -- open the 
  individual view panels, such as File System to add/change files
  * demo projects, and related files (ex Banana image)
  * any new dlls, or if the version of dependent dlls changed, you will probably
    need to re-add the files

* make setup_bin

  make the Release version of the setup project

* Make a zip

  * use something like WinZip to make a .zip file of setup_bin\Release --
    don't make a folder, just put the files into a the root of a zip
  * rename the zip file like this (ex. for rc1):
    emergent-4.0.3rc1.zip
  * make a self-extracting archive from that zip file -- it will have a .exe suffix --
    for the default extract folder, enter 'setup' so the files unpack to their own
    folder (so they are not mixed in with any other files anywhere)

* Test as upgrade

  * the VMWare vm win_xp can be used to test the install -- it usually has the previous
    version installed, and has a Reset point set to before any pdp install
  * first test on the existing version -- it should install without any complaints about
    the version etc. (it does a silent upgrade)
  * then, roll back the VM -- there should be no install of pdp
  * install again, and test
