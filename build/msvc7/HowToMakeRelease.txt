How To Make an Emergent Release

* of course bring the project up to date, and make sure everything runs in Debug build

* make the Release build, and make sure it works

* the following need to be checked/updated in the setup_bin project -- open the 
  individual view panels, such as File System to add/change files
  * demo projects, and related files (ex Banana image)
  * any new dlls, or if the version of dep dlls changed, you will probably need to 
    re-add the files

* Version
  you must increment the version number, ex if last release was 4.0.2 then it must
  be increased to at least 4.0.3
  The system will automatically offer to change the ProductCode and PackageCode, accept
  those -- DO NOT CHANGE THE UpgradeCode

* make setup_bin

  make the Release version of the setup project

* Make a zip

  * use something like WinZip to make a .zip file of setup_bin\Release --
    don't make a folder, just put the files into a the root of a zip
  * rename the zip file like this (ex. for rc1):
    emergent-4.0.3rc1.zip
  * make a self-extracting archive from that zip file -- it will have a .exe suffix --
    for the default extract folder, enter 'setup' so the files unpack to their own
    folder (so they are not mixed in with any other files anywhere)

* Test as upgrade

  * the VMWare vm win_xp can be used to test the install -- it usually has the previous
    version installed, and has a Reset point set to before any pdp install
  * first test on the existing version -- it should install without any complaints about
    the version etc. (it does a silent upgrade)
  * then, roll back the VM -- there should be no install of pdp
  * install again, and test
