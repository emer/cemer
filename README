Emergent (TM) (a major rewrite of PDP++) is a comprehensive simulation
environment for creating complex, sophisticated models of the brain
and cognitive processes using neural network models. These same
networks can also be used for all kinds of other more pragmatic tasks,
like predicting the stock market or analyzing data. It includes a full
GUI environment for constructing networks and the input/output
patterns for the networks to process, and many different analysis
tools for understanding what the networks are doing. It has a new
tabbed-browser style interface with full 3D graphics (via OpenGL and
Open Inventor/Coin3D), and powerful new GUI programming tools and data
processing and analysis capabilities.

4.0.3rc1 known issues

* to build user plugins, you must set the environment variable
  PDP4DIR to point to your pdp4 system folder, typically:
  PDP4DIR = /usr/local/share/pdp++-4.0.3rc1

* make distcheck was not run, and it is unlikely that VPATH
  building works
