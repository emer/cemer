To Do (updated 2/24/14 3pm)

I haven't really worked to make the generate process idempotent - I've always been resetting it.

Need to build the capability to load weights

Would be nice to be able to have multiple tests per project.  Most of the infrastructure is there for this,
but wouldn't work right now.
