030 README
 
threads + shared

This is based on an earlier revision of bench than 010, and uses a simple
modalized scheme to place ownership of the Conn in either the SendCons
or RecvCons -- it is a branch of 020

Memory

Memory is allocated by each XxxxCons for its objects.

Jobbing

It uses the "block-nibbling" approach in which all threads just grab the
next ready block to work on.
